         <p rend="h_2">The story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but except the obvious remark that it was <anchor xml:id="intro.2"/>gruesome<app from="intro.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">grewsome</rdg></app>, as, on Christmas eve in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to <anchor xml:id="intro.3"/>say<app from="intro.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">remark</rdg></app> that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but later in the evening—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. <anchor xml:id="intro.4"/>Someone<app from="intro.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">Some one</rdg></app> else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw
            <pb n="4"/>
            he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“I quite agree—in regard to Griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was—that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular touch. But it’s not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child. If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to <hi rend="italic">two</hi> children<anchor xml:id="intro.5"/>―<app from="intro.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“We say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, “that they give two turns! Also that we want to hear about them.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. “Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It’s quite too horrible.” This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: “It’s beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know touches it.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“For sheer terror?” I remember asking.</p>
         <pb n="5"/>
         <p rend="h_2">He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to qualify it. He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing grimace. “For dreadful—dreadfulness!”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Oh, how delicious!” cried one of the women.<!-- how to here encode difference in paragraph? xml:id="intro.6" --> He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of. “For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Well then,” I said, “just sit right down and begin.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant. Then as he faced us again: “I can’t begin. I shall have to send to town.” There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. “The story’s written. It’s in a locked drawer—it has not been out for years. I could write to my man and <anchor xml:id="intro.7"/>enclose<app from="intro.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">inclose</rdg></app> the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it.” It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this—appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons for a long silence. The others resented postponement, but it was just his scruples that charmed me. I adjured
            <pb n="6"/>him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own. To this his answer was prompt. “Oh, thank God, no!”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“And is the record yours? You took the thing down?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Nothing but the impression. I took that <hi rend="italic">here</hi>”—he tapped his heart. “I’ve never lost it.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Then your manuscript<anchor xml:id="intro.8"/>―<app from="intro.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Is in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.” He hung fire again. “A woman’s. She has been dead these twenty years. She sent me the pages in question before she died.” They were all listening now, and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the inference. But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation. “She was a most charming person, but she was ten years older than I. She was my sister’s governess,” he quietly said. “She was the most agreeable woman I’ve ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this episode was long before. I was at Trinity, and I found her at home on my coming down the second summer. I was much there that year—it was a beautiful
            <pb n="7"/>one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls and talks in the garden—talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes; don’t grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me too. If she hadn’t she wouldn’t have told me. She had never told any one. It wasn’t simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn’t<anchor xml:id="intro.9"/>.<app from="intro.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">;</rdg></app> I was sure, I could see. You’ll easily judge why when you hear.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Because the thing had been such a scare?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He continued to fix me. “You’ll easily judge,” he repeated: “<hi rend="italic">you</hi> will.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">I fixed him too. “I see. She was in love.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He laughed for the first time. “You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> acute. Yes, she was in love. That is<anchor xml:id="intro.10"/>,<app from="intro.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> she had been. That came out—she couldn’t tell her story without its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but neither of us spoke of it. I remember the time and the place—the corner of the lawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot summer afternoon. It wasn’t a scene for a shudder; but oh<anchor xml:id="intro.11"/>―<app from="intro.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>!” He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“You’ll receive the packet Thursday morning?” I inquired.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Probably not till the second post.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Well then; after dinner<anchor xml:id="intro.12"/>―<app from="intro.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>”</p>
         <pb n="8"/>
         <p rend="h_2">“You’ll all meet me here?” He looked us round again. “Isn’t anybody going?” It was almost the tone of hope.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Everybody will stay!”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“<hi rend="italic">I</hi> will—and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will!” cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed. Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light. “Who was it she was in love with?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“The story will tell,” I took upon myself to reply.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Oh, I can’t wait for the story!”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“The story <hi rend="italic">won’t</hi> tell,” said Douglas; “not in any literal, vulgar way.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“More’s the pity then. That’s the only way I ever understand.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Won’t <hi rend="italic">you</hi> tell, Douglas?” somebody else inquired.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He sprang to his feet again. “Yes—<anchor xml:id="intro.13"/><app from="intro.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">to-morrow</rdg></app>. Now I must go to bed. Good-night.” And, quickly, catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly bewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. “Well, if I don’t know who she was in love with, I know who <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“She was ten years older,” said her husband.</p>
         <!-- here first pb in Colliers_vol20no17 -->
         <!-- here second pb in Colliers_vol20no17 -->
         <p rend="h_2">“<hi rend="italic">Raison de plus</hi>—at that age! But it's rather nice, his long reticence.”</p>
         <pb n="9"/>
         <p rend="h_2">“Forty years!” Griffin put in.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“With this outbreak at last.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“The outbreak,” I returned, “will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night;” and <anchor xml:id="intro.14"/>everyone<app from="intro.14"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">every one</rdg></app> so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost all attention for <anchor xml:id="intro.15"/>everything<app from="intro.15"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">anything</rdg></app> else. The last story, however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and “candlestuck<anchor xml:id="intro.16"/>,”<app from="intro.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">”,</rdg></app> as somebody said, and went to bed.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">I knew the next day that a letter containing the key had, by the first post, gone off to his London apartments; but in spite of—or perhaps just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening, in fact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made
            <pb n="10"/>much later, is what I shall presently give. Poor Douglas, before his death—when it was in sight—committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he read to our hushed little circle on the night<anchor xml:id="intro.17"/> <app from="intro.17"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—it took almost the whole!—</rdg></app>of the fourth. The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn’t, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to London, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house, in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing
            <pb n="11"/>—this prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind. He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as a kind of <anchor xml:id="intro.18"/>favour<app from="intro.18"><rdg wit="Collier_vol20no17">favor</rdg></app>, an obligation he should gratefully incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women. He had for his town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position<anchor xml:id="intro.19"/>,—<app from="intro.19"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience<anchor xml:id="intro.20"/>,—<app from="intro.20"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>
            <pb n="12"/>very heavily on his hands. It had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman, Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without children of her own, she was<anchor xml:id="intro.21"/>,<app from="intro.21"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> by good luck<anchor xml:id="intro.22"/>,<app from="intro.22"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> extremely fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority. She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school—young as he was
            <pb n="13"/>to be sent, but what else could be done?—and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done for them <anchor xml:id="intro.23"/>quite<app from="intro.23"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">both</rdg></app> beautifully—she was a most respectable person—<!-- here have a gap in colliers for advertising...what to do -->till her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom<anchor xml:id="intro.24"/>,<app from="intro.24"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> and an old gardener, all likewise thoroughly respectable.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">So far had Douglas presented his picture when <anchor xml:id="intro.25"/>someone<app from="intro.25"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">some one</rdg></app> put a question. “And what did the former governess die of?—of so much respectability?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">Our friend’s answer was prompt. “That will come out. I don’t anticipate.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Excuse me—I thought that was just what you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> doing.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“In her successor’s place,” I suggested, “I should have wished to learn if the office brought with it<anchor xml:id="intro.26"/>―<app from="intro.26"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Necessary danger to life?” Douglas completed my thought. “She did wish to learn<anchor xml:id="intro.27"/>,<app from="intro.27"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> and
            <pb n="14"/>she did learn. You shall hear <anchor xml:id="intro.28"/>tomorrow<app from="intro.28"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">to-morrow</rdg></app> what she <anchor xml:id="intro.29"/>learnt<app from="intro.29"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">learned</rdg></app>. Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness. She hesitated—took a couple of days to consult and consider. But the salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second interview she faced the music, she engaged.” And Douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of the company, moved me to throw in—</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“The moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the splendid young man. She succumbed to it.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He got up and, as he had done the night before, went to the fire, gave a stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to us. “She saw him only twice.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Yes, but that’s just the beauty of her passion.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">A little to my surprise, on this, Douglas turned round to me. “It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the beauty of it. There were others,” he went on, “who hadn’t succumbed. He told her frankly all his difficulty—that for several applicants the conditions had been prohibitive. They were, somehow, simply afraid. It sounded dull—it sounded strange; and all the more so because of his main condition.”</p>
         <pb n="15"/>
         <p rend="h_2">“Which was<anchor xml:id="intro.30"/>―<app from="intro.30"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“That she should never trouble him—but never, never: neither appeal nor complain nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself, receive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and let him alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“But was that all her reward?” one of the ladies asked.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“She never saw him again.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Oh!” said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us again, was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till, the next night, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair, he opened the faded red covers of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album. <anchor xml:id="intro.31"/>The whole thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the first occasion<app from="intro.31"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">Then the</rdg></app> same lady put another question. “What is your title?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“I haven’t one.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Oh, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have!” I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, had begun to read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the beauty of his author’s hand.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little see-saw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days—found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this state of mind I spent the long hours of bumping, swinging coach that carried me to the stopping-place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so melancholy that
               <pb n="17"/>what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered tree-tops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the golden sky. The scene had a greatness that made it a different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately appeared at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who dropped me as decent a curtsey as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. I had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that, as I recalled it, made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what I was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I had no drop again till the next day, for I was carried triumphantly through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen, and I afterward won
               <pb n="18" break="no"/>dered that my employer had not told me more of her. I slept little that night—I was too much excited; and this astonished me too, I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the liberality with which I was treated. The large, impressive room, one of the best in the house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it, the full, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, I could see myself from head to foot, all struck me—like the extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things thrown in. It was thrown in as well, from the first moments, that I should get on with Mrs. Grose in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being so glad to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively on her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But it was a comfort that there could be no
            <pb n="19"/>uneasiness in a connection with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me, several times, rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look at such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a moment when I believed I <anchor xml:id="I.2"/>recognised<app from="I.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">recognized</rdg></app>, faint and far, the cry of a child; there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come back to me. To watch, teach, “form” little Flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at
               <pb n="20"/>night, her small white bed being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, with Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her and to determine us—I felt quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were naturally things that in Flora’s presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And the little boy—does he look like her? Is he too so very remarkable?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">One wouldn’t flatter a child. “Oh<anchor xml:id="I.2"/>,<app from="I.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app> Miss, <hi rend="italic">most</hi> remarkable. If you think well of this one!”—
            <pb n="21"/>and she stood there with a plate in her hand, beaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other with placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yes; if I do<anchor xml:id="I.3"/>―<app from="I.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be carried away by the little gentleman!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Well, that, I think, is what I came for—to be carried away. I’m afraid, however,” I remember feeling the impulse to add, “I’m rather easily carried away. I was carried away in London!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I can still see Mrs. Grose’s broad face as she took this in. “In Harley Street?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“In Harley Street.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Well<anchor xml:id="I.4"/>,<app from="I.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app> Miss, you’re not the first—and you won’t be the last.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, I’ve no pretension,” I could laugh, “to being the only one. My other pupil, at any rate, as I understand, comes back <anchor xml:id="I.5"/>tomorrow<app from="I.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">to-morrow</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Not <anchor xml:id="I.6"/>tomorrow<app from="I.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">to-morrow</rdg></app>—Friday, Miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach, under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I forthwith expressed that the proper<anchor xml:id="I.7"/><app from="I.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">,</rdg></app> as well as the pleasant and friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an idea in which Mrs. Grose concurred
               <pb n="22"/>so heartily that I
               <!-- pb here in colliers -->
               somehow took her manner as a kind of comforting pledge—never falsified, thank heaven!—that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was glad I was there!</p>
            <p rend="h_2">What I felt the next day was, I suppose, nothing that could be fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale, as I walked round them, gazed up at them, took them in, of my new circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and mass for which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out of doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step and room by room and secret by secret; with droll, delightful, childish talk about it and with the result, in half an hour, of our becoming immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little
               <pb n="23"/>tour, with her confidence and courage<anchor xml:id="I.8"/><app from="I.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">,</rdg></app> with the way, in empty chambers and dull corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since the day I left it, and I dare say that to my older and more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with her hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybooks and fairy-tales. Wasn’t it just a storybook over which I had fallen a-doze and a-dream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older, half replaced and half <anchor xml:id="I.10"/>utilised<app from="I.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">utilized</rdg></app>, in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I was, strangely, at the helm!</p>

            <p rend="h_2">This came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for an incident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply disconcerted me. The first day had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. The postbag, that evening<anchor xml:id="II.1"/>,<app from="II.1"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app>—it came late—contained a letter for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed but of a few words <anchor xml:id="II.2"/>enclosing<app from="II.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">inclosing</rdg></app> another, addressed to himself, with a seal still unbroken. “This, I <anchor xml:id="II.3"/>recognise<app from="II.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">recognize</rdg></app>, is from the head-master—and the head-master’s an awful bore. Read him, please, deal with him; but mind you don’t report. Not a word. I’m off!” I broke the seal with a great effort—so great a one that I was a long time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before going to bed. I
            <pb n="25"/>had better have let it wait till morning, for it gave me a second sleepless night. With no counsel to take, the next day, I was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that I determined to open myself at least to Mrs. Grose.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“What does it mean? The child’s dismissed his school.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. “But aren’t they all<anchor xml:id="II.3"/>―<app from="II.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Sent home—yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back at all.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. “They won’t take him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“They absolutely decline.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">At this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; I saw them fill with good tears. “What has he done?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I hesitated; then I judged best simply to hand her my letter—which, however, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put her hands behind her. She shook her head sadly. “Such things are not for me, Miss.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">My <anchor xml:id="II.4"/>counsellor<app from="II.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">counselor</rdg></app> couldn’t read! I winced at my mistake, which I attenuated as I could, and
            <pb n="26"/>opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then, faltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back in my pocket. “Is he really <hi rend="italic">bad?</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">The tears were still in her eyes. “Do the gentlemen say so?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“They go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that it should be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.” Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence, to my own mind, I went on: “That he’s an injury to the others.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly flamed up. “Master Miles!<anchor xml:id="II.5"/><app from="II.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app><hi rend="italic">him</hi> an injury?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet seen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea. I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot, sarcastically. “To his poor little innocent mates!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“It’s too dreadful!” cried Mrs. Grose, “to say such cruel things! Why, he’s scarce ten years old.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yes, yes: it would be incredible.”</p>
            <pb n="27"/>
            <p rend="h_2">She was evidently grateful for such a profession. “See him, Miss, first. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi> believe it!” I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance. “You might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her,” she added the next moment—“<hi rend="italic">look</hi> at her!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes before, I had established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil and a copy of nice <anchor xml:id="II.6"/>“<app from="II.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app>round O’s,<anchor xml:id="II.6"/>”<app from="II.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app> now presented herself to view at the open door. She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking at me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of Mrs. Grose’s comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">None the less, the rest of the day, I watched for further occasion to approach my colleague,
            <pb n="28"/>especially as, toward evening, I began to fancy she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her, holding her there with a hand on her arm. “I take what you said to me at noon as a declaration that <hi rend="italic">you’ve</hi> never known him to be bad.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very honestly, adopted an attitude. “Oh, never known him—I don’t pretend <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I was upset again. “Then you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> known him<anchor xml:id="II.7"/>―<app from="II.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yes, indeed, Miss, thank God!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">On reflection I accepted this. “You mean that a boy who never is<anchor xml:id="II.8"/>―<app from="II.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Is no boy for <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I held her tighter. “You like them with the spirit to be naughty?” Then, keeping pace with her answer, “So do I!” I eagerly brought out. “But not to the degree to contaminate<anchor xml:id="II.9"/>―<app from="II.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“To contaminate?”—my big word left her at a loss.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I explained it. “To corrupt.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced in her an odd laugh. “Are you afraid he’ll corrupt <hi rend="italic">you?</hi>” She put the question with such a fine bold <anchor xml:id="II.10"/>humour<app from="II.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">humor</rdg></app> that, with a laugh a little silly<anchor xml:id="II.11"/><app from="II.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">,</rdg></app> doubtless, to match her own, I gave
            <pb n="29"/>way for the time to the <anchor xml:id="II.12"/>apprehension of ridicule.<app from="II.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">danger of absurdity.</rdg></app></p>
            <p rend="h_2">But the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, I cropped up in another place. “What was the lady who was here before?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“The last governess? <anchor xml:id="II.13"/>She was also young and pretty—<app from="II.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">Oh, Miss Jessel—that was her name—was also young and pretty; </rdg></app>almost as young and almost as pretty, Miss, even as you.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Ah, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!” I recollect throwing off. “He seems to like us young and pretty!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, he <hi rend="italic">did</hi>,” Mrs. Grose assented: “it was the way he liked <anchor xml:id="II.14"/>everyone<app from="II.14"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">every one</rdg></app>!” She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up. “I mean that’s <hi rend="italic">his</hi> way—the master’s.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I was struck. “But of whom did you speak first?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She looked blank but she <anchor xml:id="II.15"/>coloured<app from="II.15"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">colored</rdg></app>. “Why, of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Of the master?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Of who else?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">There was so obviously no one else that the next moment I had lost my impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and I merely asked what I wanted to know. “Did <hi rend="italic">she</hi> see anything in the boy—?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“That wasn’t right? She never told me.”</p>
            <pb n="30"/>
            <p rend="h_2">I had a scruple, but I overcame it. “Was she careful—particular?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious. “About some things—yes.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“But not about all?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Again she considered. “Well, Miss—she’s gone. I won’t tell tales.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I quite understand your feeling,” I hastened to reply; but I thought it, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: “Did she die here?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“No—she went off.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I don’t know what there was in this brevity of Mrs. Grose’s that struck me as ambiguous. “Went off to die?” Mrs. Grose looked straight out of the window<anchor xml:id="II.16"/>,<app from="II.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">;</rdg></app> but I felt that, hypothetically, I had a right to know what young persons engaged for Bly were expected to do. “She was taken ill, you mean, and went home?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“She was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She left it at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. We had then a young woman—a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good girl and clever; and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> took the children altogether for the interval. But our young lady never came
            <pb n="31"/>back, and at the very moment I was expecting her I heard from the master that she was dead.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I turned this over. “But of what?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He never told me! But please, Miss,” said Mrs. Grose, “I must get to my work.”</p>

            <p rend="h_2">Her thus turning her back in me was fortunately not, for my just preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem. We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict. <anchor xml:id="III.2"/>I was a little late on the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me<app from="III.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me (I was a little late on the scene,)</rdg></app> before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down<anchor xml:id="Colliers_vol20no19"/>,<app from="III.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">—I felt</rdg></app> that I had seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the same great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. What I then and there took him to my heart for was something divine
            <pb n="33"/>that I have never found to the same degree in any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love. It would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered—so far, that is, as I was not outraged—by the sense of the horrible letter locked up, in my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could compass a private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her that it was grotesque.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">She smiled at my pretension to have discovered his charm.</p><!-- again here paragraph change...III.5 -->
            <p rend="h_2">“I assure you, Miss, I do nothing else! What will you say, then?” she immediately added.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“In answer to the letter?” I had made up my mind. “Nothing.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And to his uncle?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I was incisive. “Nothing.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And to the boy himself?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I was wonderful. “Nothing.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. “Then I’ll stand by you. We’ll see it out.”</p>
            <pb n="34"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“We’ll see it out!” I ardently echoed, giving her my hand to make it a vow.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She held me there a moment, then whisked up her apron again with her detached hand. “Would you mind, Miss, if I used the freedom<anchor xml:id="III.6"/>―<app from="III.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“To kiss me? No!” I took the good creature in my arms and, after we had embraced like sisters, felt still more fortified and indignant.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">This, at all events, was for the time<anchor xml:id="III.7"/>:<app from="III.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">;</rdg></app> a time so full that, as I recall the way it went, reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a little distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to remember at this day what proposal I framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me<anchor xml:id="III.8"/>,<app from="III.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19"/></app> indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that he was to have; but I now feel that, for <anchor xml:id="III.9"/>weeks<app from="III.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">a considerable time</rdg></app>, the lessons must have been rather my own.
            <pb n="35"/>I learned something—at first certainly—that had not been one of the teachings of my <anchor xml:id="III.10"/><app from="III.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">old </rdg></app>small, smothered life; <anchor xml:id="III.11"/>learnt<app from="III.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">learned</rdg></app> to be amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration—and consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap—not designed, but deep—to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so little trouble—they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to speculate—but even this with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be <anchor xml:id="III.12"/>enclosed<app from="III.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">inclosed</rdg></app> and protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the after-years could take for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a <anchor xml:id="III.13"/>charm<app from="III.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">spell</rdg></app> of stillness—
            <pb n="36"/>that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the spring of a beast.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">In the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, tea-time and bed-time having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions, this hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded—or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees—I could take a turn in the grounds and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified; doubtless perhaps also to reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose pressure I had responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me, and that I <hi rend="italic">could</hi>, after all, do it proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I dare say I fancied
            <pb n="37"/>myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">It was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of my very hour: the children were tucked away and I had come out for my stroll. One of the thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink now from noting, used to be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet <anchor xml:id="III.14"/>someone<app from="III.14"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">some one</rdg></app>. <anchor xml:id="III.15"/>Someone<app from="III.15"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">Someone</rdg></app> would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve. I didn’t ask more than that—I only asked that he should <hi rend="italic">know</hi><anchor xml:id="III.16"/>;<app from="III.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">,</rdg></app> and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his handsome face. That was exactly present to me—by which I mean the face was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long June day, I stopped short on emerging from <!-- two pbs here in Collier's, one an illustration page -->one of the plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the spot—and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for—was the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. He did stand there!—but high
               <pb n="38"/>up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that first morning, little Flora had conducted me. This tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated structures—that were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference, as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past. I admired them, had fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially when they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked seemed most in place.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the <anchor xml:id="III.17"/>shock<app from="III.17"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">shocks</rdg></app> of my first and <anchor xml:id="III.18"/>that<app from="III.18"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19"/></app> of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which, after these
           <pb n="39"/>years, there is no living view that I can hope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me was—a few more seconds assured me—as little any one else I knew as it was the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in Harley Street—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the strangest way in the world, had, on the instant and by the very fact of its appearance, become <anchor xml:id="III.19"/>a solitude<app from="III.19"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">lonely</rdg></app>. To <anchor xml:id="III.20"/>me<app from="III.20"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">myself</rdg></app> at least, making my statement here with a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what I did take in—all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. I can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky and the friendly hour lost, for the minute, all its voice. But there was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with a stranger sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a picture in a frame. That’s how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and that he
           <pb n="40"/>was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instants more became intense.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">The great question, or one of these, is, <anchor xml:id="III.21"/>afterwards<app from="III.21"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">afterward</rdg></app>, I know, with regard to certain matters<anchor xml:id="III.22"/>.<app from="III.22"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">,</rdg></app> the question of how long they have lasted. Well, this matter of mine, think what you will of it, lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in the house—and for how long, above all?—a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person. It lasted while this visitant, at all events<anchor xml:id="III.23"/>,<app from="III.23"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19"/></app>—and there was a touch of the strange freedom, as I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat<anchor xml:id="III.24"/>,<app from="III.24"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19"/></app>—seemed to fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. We were too far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare. He was in
         <pb n="41"/>one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me, and with both hands on the ledge. So I saw him as I see the letters I form on this page; then, exactly, after a minute, as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly changed his place—passed, looking at me hard all the while, to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the sharpest sense that, during this transit, he never took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, passed from one of the crenelations to the next. He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me. He turned away; that was all I knew.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a “secret” at Bly—a mystery of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement? I can’t say how long I turned it over, <anchor xml:id="IV.2"/>nor<app from="IV.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">or</rdg></app> how long, in a confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular part of it in fact—singular as the rest had been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This picture comes back to me in the general train—the impression, as I received it on my return, of the wide white
               <pb n="43"/><anchor xml:id="IV.3"/>panelled<app from="IV.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">paneled</rdg></app> space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. I had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it. Scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I, for a reason that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward revolution—offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day<anchor xml:id="IV.4"/>,<app from="IV.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"/></app>—or at least there were moments, snatched even from clear duties<anchor xml:id="IV.5"/>,<app from="IV.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"/></app>—when I had to shut myself up to think. It
               <pb n="44"/>was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complication. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention, that I had not been <anchor xml:id="IV.6"/>practised<app from="IV.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">practiced</rdg></app> upon by the servants nor made the object of any “game”. Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing was known around me. There was but one sane inference: <anchor xml:id="IV.6"/>someone<app from="IV.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">some one</rdg></app> had taken a liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I <anchor xml:id="IV.7"/>dipped<app from="IV.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">slipped</rdg></app> into my room and locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an intrusion; some unscrupulous <anchor xml:id="IV.8"/>traveller<app from="IV.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">traveler</rdg></app>, curious in old houses, had made his way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view and then stolen out as he came. If he had given me such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The good thing, after all, was that we should surely see no more of him.</p>
            <pb n="45"/>
            <p rend="h_2">This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to <anchor xml:id="IV.9"/>judge<app from="IV.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">feel</rdg></app> that what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora, and <anchor xml:id="IV.10"/>through nothing could I so like it as through feeling<app from="IV.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">nothing so made me like it as precisely to feel</rdg></app> that I could throw myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant <anchor xml:id="IV.11"/>joy, leading me to<app from="IV.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">delight; it made me</rdg></app> wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable <anchor xml:id="IV.12"/>grey<app from="IV.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">gray</rdg></app> prose of my office. There was to be no <anchor xml:id="IV.13"/>grey<app from="IV.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">gray</rdg></app> prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty? It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom. I don’t mean by this, of course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean that I can express no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it’s a <anchor xml:id="IV.14"/>marvel<app from="IV.14"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">wonder</rdg></app> for a governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!—I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the boy’s conduct at school. It had been promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery
            <pb n="46"/>without a pang. Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My conclusion bloomed there with the real rose-flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little <anchor xml:id="IV.15"/>horrid<app from="IV.15"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">horried</rdg></app>, unclean school-world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always, on the part of the majority—which could include even stupid, sordid head-masters—turns <anchor xml:id="IV.16"/>infallibly<app from="IV.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">straight</rdg></app> to the vindictive.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never made Miles a muff<anchor xml:id="IV.16"/><app from="IV.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">,</rdg></app>) that kept them—how shall I express it?—almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to <anchor xml:id="IV.17"/>whack<app from="IV.17"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">spank</rdg></app>! I remember feeling with Miles in especial as if he had had, as it were, no history. We expect of a <anchor xml:id="IV.18"/>small<app from="IV.18"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"/></app>child <anchor xml:id="IV.19"/>a scant<app from="IV.19"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">no long</rdg></app> one, but there was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. He had never for a second suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his
           <pb n="47"/>having really been chastised. If he had been wicked he would have “caught” it, and I should have caught it by the rebound—I should have found the trace. I found nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school, never mentioned a comrade <anchor xml:id="IV.20"/>or<app from="IV.20"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">nor</rdg></app> a master; and I, for my part, was quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to any <anchor xml:id="IV.21"/>pain<app from="IV.21"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">uneasiness</rdg></app>, and I had more <anchor xml:id="IV.22"/>pains<app from="IV.22"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">worries</rdg></app> than one. I was in receipt in these days of disturbing letters from home, where things were not going well. But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their loveliness.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">There was a Sunday—to get on—when it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence of which, as the day declined, I had arranged with Mrs. Grose that, should the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late service. The rain hap<!-- pb here in Colliers, how to deal with pb in the middle of the word -->pily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which, through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter of twenty minutes. Coming down<anchor xml:id="IV.23"/>­<!-- this is an end of line hyphen how to deal with that in the app!! --><app from="IV.23"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"> </rdg></app>
               <pb n="48"/>stairs to meet my colleague in the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received them—with a publicity perhaps not edifying—while I sat with the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by exception, in that cold clean temple of mahogany and brass, the “grown-up” dining-room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover them. The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to <anchor xml:id="IV.24"/>recognise<app from="IV.24"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">recognize</rdg></app>, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all there. The person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won’t say greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met him, catch my breath and turn cold. He was the same—he was the same, and seen, this time, as he had been before, from the waist up, the window, though the dining-room was on the ground-floor, not going down to the terrace on which he stood.
               <pb n="49"/>His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to <anchor xml:id="IV.25"/>show<app from="IV.25"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">prove to</rdg></app> me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few seconds—long enough to <anchor xml:id="IV.26"/>convince<app from="IV.26"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">show</rdg></app> me that he also saw and <anchor xml:id="IV.27"/>recognised<app from="IV.27"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">recognized</rdg></app>; but it was as if I had been looking at him for years and had known him always. Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; his stare into my face, through the glass and across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a moment during which I could still watch it, see it fix successively several other things. On the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come for <anchor xml:id="IV.27"/>someone<app from="IV.27"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">some one</rdg></app> else.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">The flash of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in the midst of dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started, as I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my visitor had vanished. I stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief
               <pb n="50"/>of this; but I took in the whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I call it time, but how long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose <anchor xml:id="IV.28"/>today<app from="IV.28"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">to-day</rdg></app> of the duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me: they couldn’t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there<anchor xml:id="IV.29"/>:<app from="IV.29"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">;</rdg></app> not there if I didn’t see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, <anchor xml:id="IV.30"/><app from="IV.30"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">I</rdg></app> went to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself where he had stood. I did so; I applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had looked, into the room. As if, at this moment, to show me exactly what his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just before, came in from the hall. With this I had the full image of a repetition of what had already occurred. She saw me as I had seen my own visitant; she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I had received. She turned white, and this made me
               <pb n="51"/>ask myself if I had blanched as much. She stared, in short, and retreated on just <hi rend="italic">my</hi> lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited I thought of more things than one. But there’s only one I take space to mention. I wondered why <hi rend="italic">she</hi> should be scared.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she loomed again into view. “What in the name of goodness is the matter<anchor xml:id="V.2"/>―<app from="V.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>?” She was now flushed and out of breath.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I said nothing till she came quite near. “With me?” I must have made a wonderful face. “Do I show it?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You’re as white as a sheet. You look awful.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. My need to respect the bloom of Mrs. Grose’s had dropped, without a rustle, from my shoulders, and if I wavered for the instant it was not with what I kept back. I put out my hand to her and she took it; I held her hard a little, liking to feel her close to me. There was a kind of support in the shy heave of her surprise. “You came for me for church, of course, but I can’t go.”</p>

            <p rend="h_2">“Through this window? Dreadful!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Well,” I said, “I’ve been frightened.” Mrs. Grose’s eyes expressed plainly that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience. Oh, it was quite settled that she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> share! “Just what you saw from the dining-room a minute ago was the effect of that.

            <p rend="h_2">Her hand tightened. “What was it?”</p>

            <p rend="h_2">“No—for reasons. But now that you’ve guessed<anchor xml:id="V.4"/>―<app from="V.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>!”</p>
            <pb n="54"/>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose’s round eyes encountered this charge. “Ah, I haven’t guessed!” she said very simply. “How can I if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> don’t imagine?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I don’t in the very least.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You’ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And on this spot just now.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose looked round again. “What was he doing on th tower?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Only standing there and looking down at me.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She thought a minute. “Was he a gentleman?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I found I had no need to think. “No.” She gazed in deeper wonder. “No.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Then nobody about the place? Nobody from the village?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Nobody—nobody. I didn’t tell you, but I made sure.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It only went indeed a little way. “But if he isn’t a gentleman<anchor xml:id="V.5"/>―<app from="V.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> he? He’s a horror.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“A horror?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He’s—God help me if I know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he is!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt inconsequence. “It’s time we should be at church.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, I’m not fit for church!”</p>
            <pb n="55"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“Won’t it do you good?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“It won’t do <hi rend="italic">them</hi><anchor xml:id="V.6"/>―<app from="V.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>!” I nodded at the house.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“The children?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I can’t leave them now.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You’re afraid<anchor xml:id="V.7"/>―<app from="V.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I spoke boldly. “I’m afraid of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose’s large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the far-away faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: I somehow made out in it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and that was as yet quite obscure to me. It comes back to me that I thought instantly of this as something I could get from her; and I felt it to be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. “When was it—on the tower?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“About the middle of the month. At this same hour.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Almost at dark,” said Mrs. Grose.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Then how did he get in?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And how did he get out?” I laughed. “I had no opportunity to ask him! This evening, you see,” I pursued, “he has not been able to get in.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He only peeps?”</p>
            <pb n="56"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“I hope it will be confined to that!” She had now let go my hand; she turned away a little. I waited an instant; then I brought out: “Go to church. Good-<anchor xml:id="V.8"/>bye<app from="V.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">by</rdg></app>. I must watch.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Slowly she faced me again. “Do you fear for <anchor xml:id="V.9"/>them?<app from="V.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"><hi rend="italic">them?</hi></rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">We met in another long look. “Don’t <hi rend="italic">you?</hi>” Instead of answering me she came nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the glass. “You see how he could see,” I meanwhile went on.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She didn’t move. “How long was he here?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Till I came out. I came to meet him.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose at last turned round, and there was still more in her face. “<hi rend="italic">I</hi> couldn’t have come out.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Neither could I!” I laughed again. “But I did come. I have my duty.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“So have I mine,” she replied; after which she added: “What is he like?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I’ve been dying to tell you. But he’s like nobody.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Nobody?” she echoed.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He has no hat.” Then seeing in her face that she already, in this, with a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added stroke to stroke. “He has red hair, very red, close-curling<anchor xml:id="V.10"/>,<app from="V.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"/></app> and a
               <pb n="57"/>pale face, long in shape, with straight, good features and little, rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange—awfully; but I only know clearly that they’re rather small and very fixed. His mouth’s wide, and his lips are thin, <!--pb here in colliers-->and except for his little whiskers he’s quite clean-shaven. He gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“An actor!” It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than Mrs. Grose at that moment.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I’ve never seen one, but so I suppose them. He’s tall, active, erect,” I continued; “but never—no, never!—a gentleman.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">My companion’s face had blanched as I went on; her round eyes started and her mild mouth gaped. “A gentleman?” she gasped, confounded, stupefied: “a gentleman <hi rend="italic">he?</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You know him then?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She visibly tried to hold herself. “But he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> handsome?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I saw the way to help her. “Remarkably!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And dressed<anchor xml:id="V.11"/>―<app from="V.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“In somebody’s clothes. They’re smart, but they’re not his own.”</p>
            <pb n="58"/>
            <p rend="h_2">She broke into a breathless affirmative groan. “They’re the master’s!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I caught it up. “You <hi rend="italic">do</hi> know him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She faltered but a second. “Quint!” she cried.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Quint?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Peter Quint—his own man, his valet, when he was here!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“When the master was?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. “He never wore his hat, but he did wear—well, there were waistcoats missed! They were both here—last year. Then the master went, and Quint was alone.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I followed, but halting a little. “Alone?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Alone, with <hi rend="italic">us</hi>.” Then, as from a deeper depth, “In charge,” she added.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And what became of him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She hung fire so long that I was still more mystified. “He went too,” she brought out at last.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Went where?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Her expression, at this, became extraordinary. “God knows where! He died.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Died?” I almost shrieked.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to <anchor xml:id="V.12"/>utter<app from="V.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">articulate</rdg></app> the wonder of it. “Yes. <anchor xml:id="V.13"/><app from="V.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">Yes. </rdg></app>Quint is dead.”</p>
