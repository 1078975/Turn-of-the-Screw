         <p rend="h_2">The story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but except the obvious remark that it was <anchor xml:id="intro.2"/>gruesome<app from="intro.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">grewsome</rdg></app>, as, on Christmas eve in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to <anchor xml:id="intro.3"/>say<app from="intro.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">remark</rdg></app> that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but later in the evening—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. <anchor xml:id="intro.4"/>Someone<app from="intro.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">Some one</rdg></app> else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw
            <pb n="4"/>
            he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“I quite agree—in regard to Griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was—that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular touch. But it’s not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child. If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to <hi rend="italic">two</hi> children<anchor xml:id="intro.5"/>―<app from="intro.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“We say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, “that they give two turns! Also that we want to hear about them.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. “Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It’s quite too horrible.” This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: “It’s beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know touches it.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“For sheer terror?” I remember asking.</p>
         <pb n="5"/>
         <p rend="h_2">He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to qualify it. He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing grimace. “For dreadful—dreadfulness!”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Oh, how delicious!” cried one of the women.<!-- how to here encode difference in paragraph? xml:id="intro.6" --> He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of. “For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Well then,” I said, “just sit right down and begin.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant. Then as he faced us again: “I can’t begin. I shall have to send to town.” There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. “The story’s written. It’s in a locked drawer—it has not been out for years. I could write to my man and <anchor xml:id="intro.7"/>enclose<app from="intro.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">inclose</rdg></app> the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it.” It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this—appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons for a long silence. The others resented postponement, but it was just his scruples that charmed me. I adjured
            <pb n="6"/>him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own. To this his answer was prompt. “Oh, thank God, no!”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“And is the record yours? You took the thing down?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Nothing but the impression. I took that <hi rend="italic">here</hi>”—he tapped his heart. “I’ve never lost it.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Then your manuscript<anchor xml:id="intro.8"/>―<app from="intro.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Is in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.” He hung fire again. “A woman’s. She has been dead these twenty years. She sent me the pages in question before she died.” They were all listening now, and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the inference. But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation. “She was a most charming person, but she was ten years older than I. She was my sister’s governess,” he quietly said. “She was the most agreeable woman I’ve ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this episode was long before. I was at Trinity, and I found her at home on my coming down the second summer. I was much there that year—it was a beautiful
            <pb n="7"/>one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls and talks in the garden—talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes; don’t grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me too. If she hadn’t she wouldn’t have told me. She had never told any one. It wasn’t simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn’t<anchor xml:id="intro.9"/>.<app from="intro.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">;</rdg></app> I was sure, I could see. You’ll easily judge why when you hear.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Because the thing had been such a scare?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He continued to fix me. “You’ll easily judge,” he repeated: “<hi rend="italic">you</hi> will.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">I fixed him too. “I see. She was in love.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He laughed for the first time. “You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> acute. Yes, she was in love. That is<anchor xml:id="intro.10"/>,<app from="intro.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> she had been. That came out—she couldn’t tell her story without its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but neither of us spoke of it. I remember the time and the place—the corner of the lawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot summer afternoon. It wasn’t a scene for a shudder; but oh<anchor xml:id="intro.11"/>―<app from="intro.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>!” He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“You’ll receive the packet Thursday morning?” I inquired.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Probably not till the second post.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Well then; after dinner<anchor xml:id="intro.12"/>―<app from="intro.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>”</p>
         <pb n="8"/>
         <p rend="h_2">“You’ll all meet me here?” He looked us round again. “Isn’t anybody going?” It was almost the tone of hope.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Everybody will stay!”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“<hi rend="italic">I</hi> will—and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will!” cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed. Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light. “Who was it she was in love with?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“The story will tell,” I took upon myself to reply.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Oh, I can’t wait for the story!”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“The story <hi rend="italic">won’t</hi> tell,” said Douglas; “not in any literal, vulgar way.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“More’s the pity then. That’s the only way I ever understand.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Won’t <hi rend="italic">you</hi> tell, Douglas?” somebody else inquired.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He sprang to his feet again. “Yes—<anchor xml:id="intro.13"/><app from="intro.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">to-morrow</rdg></app>. Now I must go to bed. Good-night.” And, quickly, catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly bewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. “Well, if I don’t know who she was in love with, I know who <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“She was ten years older,” said her husband.</p>
         <!-- here first pb in Colliers_vol20no17 -->
         <!-- here second pb in Colliers_vol20no17 -->
         <p rend="h_2">“<hi rend="italic">Raison de plus</hi>—at that age! But it's rather nice, his long reticence.”</p>
         <pb n="9"/>
         <p rend="h_2">“Forty years!” Griffin put in.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“With this outbreak at last.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“The outbreak,” I returned, “will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night;” and <anchor xml:id="intro.14"/>everyone<app from="intro.14"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">every one</rdg></app> so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost all attention for <anchor xml:id="intro.15"/>everything<app from="intro.15"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">anything</rdg></app> else. The last story, however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and “candlestuck<anchor xml:id="intro.16"/>,”<app from="intro.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">”,</rdg></app> as somebody said, and went to bed.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">I knew the next day that a letter containing the key had, by the first post, gone off to his London apartments; but in spite of—or perhaps just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening, in fact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made
            <pb n="10"/>much later, is what I shall presently give. Poor Douglas, before his death—when it was in sight—committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he read to our hushed little circle on the night<anchor xml:id="intro.17"/> <app from="intro.17"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—it took almost the whole!—</rdg></app>of the fourth. The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn’t, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to London, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house, in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing
            <pb n="11"/>—this prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind. He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as a kind of <anchor xml:id="intro.18"/>favour<app from="intro.18"><rdg wit="Collier_vol20no17">favor</rdg></app>, an obligation he should gratefully incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women. He had for his town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position<anchor xml:id="intro.19"/>,—<app from="intro.19"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience<anchor xml:id="intro.20"/>,—<app from="intro.20"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>
            <pb n="12"/>very heavily on his hands. It had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman, Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without children of her own, she was<anchor xml:id="intro.21"/>,<app from="intro.21"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> by good luck<anchor xml:id="intro.22"/>,<app from="intro.22"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> extremely fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority. She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school—young as he was
            <pb n="13"/>to be sent, but what else could be done?—and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done for them <anchor xml:id="intro.23"/>quite<app from="intro.23"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">both</rdg></app> beautifully—she was a most respectable person—<!-- here have a gap in colliers for advertising...what to do -->till her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom<anchor xml:id="intro.24"/>,<app from="intro.24"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> and an old gardener, all likewise thoroughly respectable.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">So far had Douglas presented his picture when <anchor xml:id="intro.25"/>someone<app from="intro.25"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">some one</rdg></app> put a question. “And what did the former governess die of?—of so much respectability?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">Our friend’s answer was prompt. “That will come out. I don’t anticipate.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Excuse me—I thought that was just what you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> doing.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“In her successor’s place,” I suggested, “I should have wished to learn if the office brought with it<anchor xml:id="intro.26"/>―<app from="intro.26"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Necessary danger to life?” Douglas completed my thought. “She did wish to learn<anchor xml:id="intro.27"/>,<app from="intro.27"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17"/></app> and
            <pb n="14"/>she did learn. You shall hear <anchor xml:id="intro.28"/>tomorrow<app from="intro.28"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">to-morrow</rdg></app> what she <anchor xml:id="intro.29"/>learnt<app from="intro.29"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">learned</rdg></app>. Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness. She hesitated—took a couple of days to consult and consider. But the salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second interview she faced the music, she engaged.” And Douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of the company, moved me to throw in—</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“The moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the splendid young man. She succumbed to it.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">He got up and, as he had done the night before, went to the fire, gave a stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to us. “She saw him only twice.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Yes, but that’s just the beauty of her passion.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">A little to my surprise, on this, Douglas turned round to me. “It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the beauty of it. There were others,” he went on, “who hadn’t succumbed. He told her frankly all his difficulty—that for several applicants the conditions had been prohibitive. They were, somehow, simply afraid. It sounded dull—it sounded strange; and all the more so because of his main condition.”</p>
         <pb n="15"/>
         <p rend="h_2">“Which was<anchor xml:id="intro.30"/>―<app from="intro.30"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“That she should never trouble him—but never, never: neither appeal nor complain nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself, receive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and let him alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“But was that all her reward?” one of the ladies asked.</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“She never saw him again.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Oh!” said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us again, was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till, the next night, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair, he opened the faded red covers of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album. <anchor xml:id="intro.31"/>The whole thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the first occasion<app from="intro.31"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no17">Then the</rdg></app> same lady put another question. “What is your title?”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“I haven’t one.”</p>
         <p rend="h_2">“Oh, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have!” I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, had begun to read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the beauty of his author’s hand.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little see-saw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days—found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this state of mind I spent the long hours of bumping, swinging coach that carried me to the stopping-place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so melancholy that
               <pb n="17"/>what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered tree-tops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the golden sky. The scene had a greatness that made it a different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately appeared at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who dropped me as decent a curtsey as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. I had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that, as I recalled it, made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what I was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I had no drop again till the next day, for I was carried triumphantly through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen, and I afterward won
               <pb n="18" break="no"/>dered that my employer had not told me more of her. I slept little that night—I was too much excited; and this astonished me too, I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the liberality with which I was treated. The large, impressive room, one of the best in the house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it, the full, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, I could see myself from head to foot, all struck me—like the extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things thrown in. It was thrown in as well, from the first moments, that I should get on with Mrs. Grose in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being so glad to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively on her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But it was a comfort that there could be no
            <pb n="19"/>uneasiness in a connection with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me, several times, rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look at such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a moment when I believed I <anchor xml:id="I.2"/>recognised<app from="I.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">recognized</rdg></app>, faint and far, the cry of a child; there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come back to me. To watch, teach, “form” little Flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at
               <pb n="20"/>night, her small white bed being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, with Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her and to determine us—I felt quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were naturally things that in Flora’s presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And the little boy—does he look like her? Is he too so very remarkable?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">One wouldn’t flatter a child. “Oh<anchor xml:id="I.2"/>,<app from="I.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app> Miss, <hi rend="italic">most</hi> remarkable. If you think well of this one!”—
            <pb n="21"/>and she stood there with a plate in her hand, beaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other with placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yes; if I do<anchor xml:id="I.3"/>―<app from="I.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be carried away by the little gentleman!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Well, that, I think, is what I came for—to be carried away. I’m afraid, however,” I remember feeling the impulse to add, “I’m rather easily carried away. I was carried away in London!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I can still see Mrs. Grose’s broad face as she took this in. “In Harley Street?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“In Harley Street.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Well<anchor xml:id="I.4"/>,<app from="I.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app> Miss, you’re not the first—and you won’t be the last.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, I’ve no pretension,” I could laugh, “to being the only one. My other pupil, at any rate, as I understand, comes back <anchor xml:id="I.5"/>tomorrow<app from="I.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">to-morrow</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Not <anchor xml:id="I.6"/>tomorrow<app from="I.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">to-morrow</rdg></app>—Friday, Miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach, under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I forthwith expressed that the proper<anchor xml:id="I.7"/><app from="I.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">,</rdg></app> as well as the pleasant and friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an idea in which Mrs. Grose concurred
               <pb n="22"/>so heartily that I
               <!-- pb here in colliers -->
               somehow took her manner as a kind of comforting pledge—never falsified, thank heaven!—that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was glad I was there!</p>
            <p rend="h_2">What I felt the next day was, I suppose, nothing that could be fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale, as I walked round them, gazed up at them, took them in, of my new circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and mass for which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out of doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step and room by room and secret by secret; with droll, delightful, childish talk about it and with the result, in half an hour, of our becoming immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little
               <pb n="23"/>tour, with her confidence and courage<anchor xml:id="I.8"/><app from="I.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">,</rdg></app> with the way, in empty chambers and dull corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since the day I left it, and I dare say that to my older and more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with her hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybooks and fairy-tales. Wasn’t it just a storybook over which I had fallen a-doze and a-dream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older, half replaced and half <anchor xml:id="I.10"/>utilised<app from="I.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">utilized</rdg></app>, in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I was, strangely, at the helm!</p>

            <p rend="h_2">This came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for an incident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply disconcerted me. The first day had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. The postbag, that evening<anchor xml:id="II.1"/>,<app from="II.1"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app>—it came late—contained a letter for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed but of a few words <anchor xml:id="II.2"/>enclosing<app from="II.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">inclosing</rdg></app> another, addressed to himself, with a seal still unbroken. “This, I <anchor xml:id="II.3"/>recognise<app from="II.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">recognize</rdg></app>, is from the head-master—and the head-master’s an awful bore. Read him, please, deal with him; but mind you don’t report. Not a word. I’m off!” I broke the seal with a great effort—so great a one that I was a long time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before going to bed. I
            <pb n="25"/>had better have let it wait till morning, for it gave me a second sleepless night. With no counsel to take, the next day, I was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that I determined to open myself at least to Mrs. Grose.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“What does it mean? The child’s dismissed his school.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. “But aren’t they all<anchor xml:id="II.3"/>―<app from="II.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Sent home—yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back at all.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. “They won’t take him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“They absolutely decline.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">At this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; I saw them fill with good tears. “What has he done?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I hesitated; then I judged best simply to hand her my letter—which, however, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put her hands behind her. She shook her head sadly. “Such things are not for me, Miss.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">My <anchor xml:id="II.4"/>counsellor<app from="II.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">counselor</rdg></app> couldn’t read! I winced at my mistake, which I attenuated as I could, and
            <pb n="26"/>opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then, faltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back in my pocket. “Is he really <hi rend="italic">bad?</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">The tears were still in her eyes. “Do the gentlemen say so?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“They go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that it should be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.” Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence, to my own mind, I went on: “That he’s an injury to the others.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly flamed up. “Master Miles!<anchor xml:id="II.5"/><app from="II.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app><hi rend="italic">him</hi> an injury?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet seen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea. I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot, sarcastically. “To his poor little innocent mates!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“It’s too dreadful!” cried Mrs. Grose, “to say such cruel things! Why, he’s scarce ten years old.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yes, yes: it would be incredible.”</p>
            <pb n="27"/>
            <p rend="h_2">She was evidently grateful for such a profession. “See him, Miss, first. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi> believe it!” I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance. “You might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her,” she added the next moment—“<hi rend="italic">look</hi> at her!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes before, I had established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil and a copy of nice <anchor xml:id="II.6"/>“<app from="II.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app>round O’s,<anchor xml:id="II.6"/>”<app from="II.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18"/></app> now presented herself to view at the open door. She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking at me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of Mrs. Grose’s comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">None the less, the rest of the day, I watched for further occasion to approach my colleague,
            <pb n="28"/>especially as, toward evening, I began to fancy she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her, holding her there with a hand on her arm. “I take what you said to me at noon as a declaration that <hi rend="italic">you’ve</hi> never known him to be bad.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very honestly, adopted an attitude. “Oh, never known him—I don’t pretend <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I was upset again. “Then you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> known him<anchor xml:id="II.7"/>―<app from="II.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yes, indeed, Miss, thank God!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">On reflection I accepted this. “You mean that a boy who never is<anchor xml:id="II.8"/>―<app from="II.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Is no boy for <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I held her tighter. “You like them with the spirit to be naughty?” Then, keeping pace with her answer, “So do I!” I eagerly brought out. “But not to the degree to contaminate<anchor xml:id="II.9"/>―<app from="II.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“To contaminate?”—my big word left her at a loss.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I explained it. “To corrupt.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced in her an odd laugh. “Are you afraid he’ll corrupt <hi rend="italic">you?</hi>” She put the question with such a fine bold <anchor xml:id="II.10"/>humour<app from="II.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">humor</rdg></app> that, with a laugh a little silly<anchor xml:id="II.11"/><app from="II.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">,</rdg></app> doubtless, to match her own, I gave
            <pb n="29"/>way for the time to the <anchor xml:id="II.12"/>apprehension of ridicule.<app from="II.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">danger of absurdity.</rdg></app></p>
            <p rend="h_2">But the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, I cropped up in another place. “What was the lady who was here before?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“The last governess? <anchor xml:id="II.13"/>She was also young and pretty—<app from="II.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">Oh, Miss Jessel—that was her name—was also young and pretty; </rdg></app>almost as young and almost as pretty, Miss, even as you.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Ah, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!” I recollect throwing off. “He seems to like us young and pretty!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, he <hi rend="italic">did</hi>,” Mrs. Grose assented: “it was the way he liked <anchor xml:id="II.14"/>everyone<app from="II.14"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">every one</rdg></app>!” She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up. “I mean that’s <hi rend="italic">his</hi> way—the master’s.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I was struck. “But of whom did you speak first?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She looked blank but she <anchor xml:id="II.15"/>coloured<app from="II.15"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">colored</rdg></app>. “Why, of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Of the master?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Of who else?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">There was so obviously no one else that the next moment I had lost my impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and I merely asked what I wanted to know. “Did <hi rend="italic">she</hi> see anything in the boy—?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“That wasn’t right? She never told me.”</p>
            <pb n="30"/>
            <p rend="h_2">I had a scruple, but I overcame it. “Was she careful—particular?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious. “About some things—yes.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“But not about all?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Again she considered. “Well, Miss—she’s gone. I won’t tell tales.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I quite understand your feeling,” I hastened to reply; but I thought it, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: “Did she die here?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“No—she went off.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I don’t know what there was in this brevity of Mrs. Grose’s that struck me as ambiguous. “Went off to die?” Mrs. Grose looked straight out of the window<anchor xml:id="II.16"/>,<app from="II.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no18">;</rdg></app> but I felt that, hypothetically, I had a right to know what young persons engaged for Bly were expected to do. “She was taken ill, you mean, and went home?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“She was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She left it at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. We had then a young woman—a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good girl and clever; and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> took the children altogether for the interval. But our young lady never came
            <pb n="31"/>back, and at the very moment I was expecting her I heard from the master that she was dead.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I turned this over. “But of what?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He never told me! But please, Miss,” said Mrs. Grose, “I must get to my work.”</p>

            <p rend="h_2">Her thus turning her back in me was fortunately not, for my just preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem. We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict. <anchor xml:id="III.2"/>I was a little late on the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me<app from="III.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me (I was a little late on the scene,)</rdg></app> before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down<anchor xml:id="Colliers_vol20no19"/>,<app from="III.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">—I felt</rdg></app> that I had seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the same great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. What I then and there took him to my heart for was something divine
            <pb n="33"/>that I have never found to the same degree in any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love. It would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered—so far, that is, as I was not outraged—by the sense of the horrible letter locked up, in my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could compass a private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her that it was grotesque.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">She smiled at my pretension to have discovered his charm.</p><!-- again here paragraph change...III.5 -->
            <p rend="h_2">“I assure you, Miss, I do nothing else! What will you say, then?” she immediately added.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“In answer to the letter?” I had made up my mind. “Nothing.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And to his uncle?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I was incisive. “Nothing.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And to the boy himself?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I was wonderful. “Nothing.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. “Then I’ll stand by you. We’ll see it out.”</p>
            <pb n="34"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“We’ll see it out!” I ardently echoed, giving her my hand to make it a vow.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She held me there a moment, then whisked up her apron again with her detached hand. “Would you mind, Miss, if I used the freedom<anchor xml:id="III.6"/>―<app from="III.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“To kiss me? No!” I took the good creature in my arms and, after we had embraced like sisters, felt still more fortified and indignant.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">This, at all events, was for the time<anchor xml:id="III.7"/>:<app from="III.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">;</rdg></app> a time so full that, as I recall the way it went, reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a little distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to remember at this day what proposal I framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me<anchor xml:id="III.8"/>,<app from="III.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19"/></app> indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that he was to have; but I now feel that, for <anchor xml:id="III.9"/>weeks<app from="III.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">a considerable time</rdg></app>, the lessons must have been rather my own.
            <pb n="35"/>I learned something—at first certainly—that had not been one of the teachings of my <anchor xml:id="III.10"/><app from="III.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">old </rdg></app>small, smothered life; <anchor xml:id="III.11"/>learnt<app from="III.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">learned</rdg></app> to be amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration—and consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap—not designed, but deep—to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so little trouble—they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to speculate—but even this with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be <anchor xml:id="III.12"/>enclosed<app from="III.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">inclosed</rdg></app> and protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the after-years could take for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a <anchor xml:id="III.13"/>charm<app from="III.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">spell</rdg></app> of stillness—
            <pb n="36"/>that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the spring of a beast.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">In the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, tea-time and bed-time having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions, this hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded—or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees—I could take a turn in the grounds and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified; doubtless perhaps also to reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose pressure I had responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me, and that I <hi rend="italic">could</hi>, after all, do it proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I dare say I fancied
            <pb n="37"/>myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">It was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of my very hour: the children were tucked away and I had come out for my stroll. One of the thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink now from noting, used to be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet <anchor xml:id="III.14"/>someone<app from="III.14"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">some one</rdg></app>. <anchor xml:id="III.15"/>Someone<app from="III.15"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">Someone</rdg></app> would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve. I didn’t ask more than that—I only asked that he should <hi rend="italic">know</hi><anchor xml:id="III.16"/>;<app from="III.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">,</rdg></app> and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his handsome face. That was exactly present to me—by which I mean the face was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long June day, I stopped short on emerging from <!-- two pbs here in Collier's, one an illustration page -->one of the plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the spot—and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for—was the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. He did stand there!—but high
               <pb n="38"/>up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that first morning, little Flora had conducted me. This tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated structures—that were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference, as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past. I admired them, had fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially when they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked seemed most in place.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the <anchor xml:id="III.17"/>shock<app from="III.17"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">shocks</rdg></app> of my first and <anchor xml:id="III.18"/>that<app from="III.18"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19"/></app> of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which, after these
           <pb n="39"/>years, there is no living view that I can hope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me was—a few more seconds assured me—as little any one else I knew as it was the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in Harley Street—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the strangest way in the world, had, on the instant and by the very fact of its appearance, become <anchor xml:id="III.19"/>a solitude<app from="III.19"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">lonely</rdg></app>. To <anchor xml:id="III.20"/>me<app from="III.20"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">myself</rdg></app> at least, making my statement here with a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what I did take in—all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. I can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky and the friendly hour lost, for the minute, all its voice. But there was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with a stranger sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a picture in a frame. That’s how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and that he
           <pb n="40"/>was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instants more became intense.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">The great question, or one of these, is, <anchor xml:id="III.21"/>afterwards<app from="III.21"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">afterward</rdg></app>, I know, with regard to certain matters<anchor xml:id="III.22"/>.<app from="III.22"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19">,</rdg></app> the question of how long they have lasted. Well, this matter of mine, think what you will of it, lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in the house—and for how long, above all?—a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person. It lasted while this visitant, at all events<anchor xml:id="III.23"/>,<app from="III.23"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19"/></app>—and there was a touch of the strange freedom, as I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat<anchor xml:id="III.24"/>,<app from="III.24"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no19"/></app>—seemed to fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. We were too far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare. He was in
         <pb n="41"/>one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me, and with both hands on the ledge. So I saw him as I see the letters I form on this page; then, exactly, after a minute, as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly changed his place—passed, looking at me hard all the while, to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the sharpest sense that, during this transit, he never took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, passed from one of the crenelations to the next. He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me. He turned away; that was all I knew.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a “secret” at Bly—a mystery of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement? I can’t say how long I turned it over, <anchor xml:id="IV.2"/>nor<app from="IV.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">or</rdg></app> how long, in a confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular part of it in fact—singular as the rest had been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This picture comes back to me in the general train—the impression, as I received it on my return, of the wide white
               <pb n="43"/><anchor xml:id="IV.3"/>panelled<app from="IV.3"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">paneled</rdg></app> space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. I had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it. Scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I, for a reason that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward revolution—offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day<anchor xml:id="IV.4"/>,<app from="IV.4"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"/></app>—or at least there were moments, snatched even from clear duties<anchor xml:id="IV.5"/>,<app from="IV.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"/></app>—when I had to shut myself up to think. It
               <pb n="44"/>was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complication. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention, that I had not been <anchor xml:id="IV.6"/>practised<app from="IV.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">practiced</rdg></app> upon by the servants nor made the object of any “game”. Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing was known around me. There was but one sane inference: <anchor xml:id="IV.6"/>someone<app from="IV.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">some one</rdg></app> had taken a liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I <anchor xml:id="IV.7"/>dipped<app from="IV.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">slipped</rdg></app> into my room and locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an intrusion; some unscrupulous <anchor xml:id="IV.8"/>traveller<app from="IV.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">traveler</rdg></app>, curious in old houses, had made his way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view and then stolen out as he came. If he had given me such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The good thing, after all, was that we should surely see no more of him.</p>
            <pb n="45"/>
            <p rend="h_2">This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to <anchor xml:id="IV.9"/>judge<app from="IV.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">feel</rdg></app> that what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora, and <anchor xml:id="IV.10"/>through nothing could I so like it as through feeling<app from="IV.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">nothing so made me like it as precisely to feel</rdg></app> that I could throw myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant <anchor xml:id="IV.11"/>joy, leading me to<app from="IV.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">delight; it made me</rdg></app> wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable <anchor xml:id="IV.12"/>grey<app from="IV.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">gray</rdg></app> prose of my office. There was to be no <anchor xml:id="IV.13"/>grey<app from="IV.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">gray</rdg></app> prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty? It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom. I don’t mean by this, of course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean that I can express no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it’s a <anchor xml:id="IV.14"/>marvel<app from="IV.14"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">wonder</rdg></app> for a governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!—I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the boy’s conduct at school. It had been promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery
            <pb n="46"/>without a pang. Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My conclusion bloomed there with the real rose-flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little <anchor xml:id="IV.15"/>horrid<app from="IV.15"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">horried</rdg></app>, unclean school-world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always, on the part of the majority—which could include even stupid, sordid head-masters—turns <anchor xml:id="IV.16"/>infallibly<app from="IV.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">straight</rdg></app> to the vindictive.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never made Miles a muff<anchor xml:id="IV.16"/><app from="IV.16"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">,</rdg></app>) that kept them—how shall I express it?—almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to <anchor xml:id="IV.17"/>whack<app from="IV.17"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">spank</rdg></app>! I remember feeling with Miles in especial as if he had had, as it were, no history. We expect of a <anchor xml:id="IV.18"/>small<app from="IV.18"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"/></app>child <anchor xml:id="IV.19"/>a scant<app from="IV.19"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">no long</rdg></app> one, but there was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. He had never for a second suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his
           <pb n="47"/>having really been chastised. If he had been wicked he would have “caught” it, and I should have caught it by the rebound—I should have found the trace. I found nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school, never mentioned a comrade <anchor xml:id="IV.20"/>or<app from="IV.20"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">nor</rdg></app> a master; and I, for my part, was quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to any <anchor xml:id="IV.21"/>pain<app from="IV.21"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">uneasiness</rdg></app>, and I had more <anchor xml:id="IV.22"/>pains<app from="IV.22"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">worries</rdg></app> than one. I was in receipt in these days of disturbing letters from home, where things were not going well. But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their loveliness.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">There was a Sunday—to get on—when it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence of which, as the day declined, I had arranged with Mrs. Grose that, should the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late service. The rain hap<!-- pb here in Colliers, how to deal with pb in the middle of the word -->pily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which, through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter of twenty minutes. Coming down<anchor xml:id="IV.23"/>­<!-- this is an end of line hyphen how to deal with that in the app!! --><app from="IV.23"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"> </rdg></app>
               <pb n="48"/>stairs to meet my colleague in the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received them—with a publicity perhaps not edifying—while I sat with the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by exception, in that cold clean temple of mahogany and brass, the “grown-up” dining-room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover them. The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to <anchor xml:id="IV.24"/>recognise<app from="IV.24"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">recognize</rdg></app>, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all there. The person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won’t say greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met him, catch my breath and turn cold. He was the same—he was the same, and seen, this time, as he had been before, from the waist up, the window, though the dining-room was on the ground-floor, not going down to the terrace on which he stood.
               <pb n="49"/>His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to <anchor xml:id="IV.25"/>show<app from="IV.25"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">prove to</rdg></app> me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few seconds—long enough to <anchor xml:id="IV.26"/>convince<app from="IV.26"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">show</rdg></app> me that he also saw and <anchor xml:id="IV.27"/>recognised<app from="IV.27"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">recognized</rdg></app>; but it was as if I had been looking at him for years and had known him always. Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; his stare into my face, through the glass and across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a moment during which I could still watch it, see it fix successively several other things. On the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come for <anchor xml:id="IV.27"/>someone<app from="IV.27"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">some one</rdg></app> else.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">The flash of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in the midst of dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started, as I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my visitor had vanished. I stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief
               <pb n="50"/>of this; but I took in the whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I call it time, but how long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose <anchor xml:id="IV.28"/>today<app from="IV.28"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">to-day</rdg></app> of the duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me: they couldn’t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there<anchor xml:id="IV.29"/>:<app from="IV.29"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">;</rdg></app> not there if I didn’t see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, <anchor xml:id="IV.30"/><app from="IV.30"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">I</rdg></app> went to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself where he had stood. I did so; I applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had looked, into the room. As if, at this moment, to show me exactly what his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just before, came in from the hall. With this I had the full image of a repetition of what had already occurred. She saw me as I had seen my own visitant; she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I had received. She turned white, and this made me
               <pb n="51"/>ask myself if I had blanched as much. She stared, in short, and retreated on just <hi rend="italic">my</hi> lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited I thought of more things than one. But there’s only one I take space to mention. I wondered why <hi rend="italic">she</hi> should be scared.</p>

            <p rend="h_2">Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she loomed again into view. “What in the name of goodness is the matter<anchor xml:id="V.2"/>―<app from="V.2"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>?” She was now flushed and out of breath.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I said nothing till she came quite near. “With me?” I must have made a wonderful face. “Do I show it?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You’re as white as a sheet. You look awful.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. My need to respect the bloom of Mrs. Grose’s had dropped, without a rustle, from my shoulders, and if I wavered for the instant it was not with what I kept back. I put out my hand to her and she took it; I held her hard a little, liking to feel her close to me. There was a kind of support in the shy heave of her surprise. “You came for me for church, of course, but I can’t go.”</p>

            <p rend="h_2">“Through this window? Dreadful!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Well,” I said, “I’ve been frightened.” Mrs. Grose’s eyes expressed plainly that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience. Oh, it was quite settled that she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> share! “Just what you saw from the dining-room a minute ago was the effect of that.

            <p rend="h_2">Her hand tightened. “What was it?”</p>

            <pb n="54"/>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose’s round eyes encountered this charge. “Ah, I haven’t guessed!” she said very simply. “How can I if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> don’t imagine?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I don’t in the very least.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You’ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And on this spot just now.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose looked round again. “What was he doing on th tower?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Only standing there and looking down at me.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She thought a minute. “Was he a gentleman?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I found I had no need to think. “No.” She gazed in deeper wonder. “No.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Then nobody about the place? Nobody from the village?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Nobody—nobody. I didn’t tell you, but I made sure.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It only went indeed a little way. “But if he isn’t a gentleman<anchor xml:id="V.5"/>―<app from="V.5"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> he? He’s a horror.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“A horror?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He’s—God help me if I know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he is!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt inconsequence. “It’s time we should be at church.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, I’m not fit for church!”</p>
            <pb n="55"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“Won’t it do you good?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“It won’t do <hi rend="italic">them</hi><anchor xml:id="V.6"/>―<app from="V.6"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>!” I nodded at the house.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“The children?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I can’t leave them now.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You’re afraid<anchor xml:id="V.7"/>―<app from="V.7"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I spoke boldly. “I’m afraid of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose’s large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the far-away faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: I somehow made out in it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and that was as yet quite obscure to me. It comes back to me that I thought instantly of this as something I could get from her; and I felt it to be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. “When was it—on the tower?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“About the middle of the month. At this same hour.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Almost at dark,” said Mrs. Grose.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Then how did he get in?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And how did he get out?” I laughed. “I had no opportunity to ask him! This evening, you see,” I pursued, “he has not been able to get in.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He only peeps?”</p>
            <pb n="56"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“I hope it will be confined to that!” She had now let go my hand; she turned away a little. I waited an instant; then I brought out: “Go to church. Good-<anchor xml:id="V.8"/>bye<app from="V.8"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">by</rdg></app>. I must watch.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Slowly she faced me again. “Do you fear for <anchor xml:id="V.9"/>them?<app from="V.9"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"><hi rend="italic">them?</hi></rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">We met in another long look. “Don’t <hi rend="italic">you?</hi>” Instead of answering me she came nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the glass. “You see how he could see,” I meanwhile went on.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She didn’t move. “How long was he here?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Till I came out. I came to meet him.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose at last turned round, and there was still more in her face. “<hi rend="italic">I</hi> couldn’t have come out.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Neither could I!” I laughed again. “But I did come. I have my duty.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“So have I mine,” she replied; after which she added: “What is he like?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I’ve been dying to tell you. But he’s like nobody.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Nobody?” she echoed.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He has no hat.” Then seeing in her face that she already, in this, with a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added stroke to stroke. “He has red hair, very red, close-curling<anchor xml:id="V.10"/>,<app from="V.10"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20"/></app> and a
               <pb n="57"/>pale face, long in shape, with straight, good features and little, rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange—awfully; but I only know clearly that they’re rather small and very fixed. His mouth’s wide, and his lips are thin, <!--pb here in colliers-->and except for his little whiskers he’s quite clean-shaven. He gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“An actor!” It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than Mrs. Grose at that moment.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I’ve never seen one, but so I suppose them. He’s tall, active, erect,” I continued; “but never—no, never!—a gentleman.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">My companion’s face had blanched as I went on; her round eyes started and her mild mouth gaped. “A gentleman?” she gasped, confounded, stupefied: “a gentleman <hi rend="italic">he?</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You know him then?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She visibly tried to hold herself. “But he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> handsome?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I saw the way to help her. “Remarkably!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And dressed<anchor xml:id="V.11"/>―<app from="V.11"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“In somebody’s clothes. They’re smart, but they’re not his own.”</p>
            <pb n="58"/>
            <p rend="h_2">She broke into a breathless affirmative groan. “They’re the master’s!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I caught it up. “You <hi rend="italic">do</hi> know him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She faltered but a second. “Quint!” she cried.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Quint?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Peter Quint—his own man, his valet, when he was here!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“When the master was?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. “He never wore his hat, but he did wear—well, there were waistcoats missed! They were both here—last year. Then the master went, and Quint was alone.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I followed, but halting a little. “Alone?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Alone, with <hi rend="italic">us</hi>.” Then, as from a deeper depth, “In charge,” she added.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And what became of him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She hung fire so long that I was still more mystified. “He went too,” she brought out at last.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Went where?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Her expression, at this, became extraordinary. “God knows where! He died.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Died?” I almost shrieked.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to <anchor xml:id="V.12"/>utter<app from="V.12"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">articulate</rdg></app> the wonder of it. “Yes. <anchor xml:id="V.13"/><app from="V.13"><rdg wit="Colliers_vol20no20">Yes. </rdg></app>Quint is dead.”</p>

            <p rend="h_2">It took of course more than that particular passage to place us together in presence of what we had now to live with as we could—my dreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified, and my companion’s knowledge, henceforth<anchor xml:id="VI.2"/>,<app from="VI.2"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21"/></app>—a knowledge half consternation and half compassion<anchor xml:id="VI.3"/>,<app from="VI.3"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21"/></app>—of that liability. There had been, this evening, after the revelation that left me, for an hour, so <anchor xml:id="VI.4"/>prostrate<app from="VI.4"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">stupefied</rdg></app>—there had been, for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual challenges and pledges that had straight-way ensued on our retreating together to <anchor xml:id="VI.5"/>the schoolroom<app from="VI.5"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">Mrs. Grose’s room</rdg></app> and shutting ourselves up there to have everything out. The result of our having everything out was simply to reduce our situation to the last <anchor xml:id="VI.6"/>rigour<app from="VI.6"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">rigor</rdg></app> of its elements. She herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and no
               <pb n="60" break="no"/>body in the house but the governess was in the governess’s plight; yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it to her, and ended by showing me, on this ground, an awe-stricken tenderness, an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we thought we might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in spite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I knew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later what I was capable of meeting to <anchor xml:id="VI.7"/>shelter<app from="VI.7"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">protect</rdg></app> my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a contact. I was queer company enough—quite as queer as the company I received; but as I trace over what we went through I see how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good fortune, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that led me straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I could take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could join me.
               <pb n="61"/>Perfectly can I recall now the particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night. We had gone over and over every feature of what I had seen.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He was looking for some one else, you say—some one who was not you?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He was looking for little Miles.”  A portentous clearness now possessed me. “<hi rend="italic">That’s</hi> whom he was looking for.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“But how do you know?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I know, I know, I know!” My exaltation grew. “And <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know my dear!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She didn’t deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling as that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: “What if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should see him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Little Miles?” That’s what he wants!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She looked immensely scared again. “The child?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Heaven forbid! The man. He wants to appear to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>.” That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in practically proving. I had an absolute certainty that I should see again what I had already seen, but something within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject
               <pb n="62"/>of such experience, by accepting, by inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquillity of my companions. The children, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I recall one of the last things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“It does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned<anchor xml:id="VI.8"/>―<app from="VI.8"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She looked at me hard as I musingly pulled up. “His having been here and the time they were with him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“The time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history, in any way.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, the little lady doesn’t remember. She never heard or knew.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“The circumstances of his death?” I thought with some intensity. “Perhaps not. But Miles would remember—Miles would know.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Ah, don’t try him!” broke from Mrs. Grose.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I returned her the look she had given me. “Don’t be afraid.” I continued to think. “It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> rather odd.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“That he has never spoken of him?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Never by the least allusion. And you tell me they were ‘great friends’?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, it wasn’t <hi rend="italic">him!</hi>” Mrs. Grose with emphasis declared. “It was Quint’s own fancy. To
               <pb n="63"/>play with him, I mean—to spoil him.” She paused a moment; then she added: “Quint was much too free.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">This gave me, straight from my vision of his face—<hi rend="italic">such</hi> a face!—a sudden sickness of disgust. “Too free with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> boy?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Too free with every one!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I forbore, for the moment, to analyze this description further than by the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of the household, of the half-dozen maids and men, who were still of our <anchor xml:id="VI.9"/>small<app from="VI.9"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">little</rdg></app> colony. But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the lucky fact that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation of <anchor xml:id="VI.10"/>scullions<app from="VI.10"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">the kitchen</rdg></app>, had ever, within any one’s memory, attached to the kind old place. It had neither bad name nor ill fame, and Mrs. Grose, most apparently, only desired to cling to me and to quake in silence. I even put her, the very last thing of all, to the test. It was when, at midnight, she had her hand on my door to take leave. “I have it from you then—for it’s of great importance—that he was definitely and admittedly bad?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, not admittedly. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> knew it—but the master didn’t.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And you never told him?”</p>
            <pb n="64"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“Well, he didn’t like tale-bearing—he hated complaints. He was terribly short with anything of that kind, and if people were all right to <hi rend="italic">him</hi><anchor xml:id="VI.11"/>―<app from="VI.11"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“He wouldn’t be bothered with more?” This squared well enough with my impression of him: he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very particular, perhaps, about some of the company <anchor xml:id="VI.12"/><hi rend="italic">he</hi><app from="VI.12"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">he himself</rdg></app> kept. All the same, I pressed my interlocutress. “I promise you <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would have told!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She felt my discrimination. “I daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was afraid.”</p>
            <!-- pb here in Colliers -->
            <p rend="h_2">“Afraid of what?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Of things that man could do. Quint was so clever—he was so deep.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. “You weren’t afraid of anything else? Not of his effect<anchor xml:id="VI.13"/>―<app from="VI.13"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“His effect?” she repeated with <anchor xml:id="VI.14"/>a face of anguish<app from="VI.14"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">an uneasy face</rdg></app> and waiting while I faltered.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“On innocent little precious lives. They were in your charge.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“No, they were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in mine!” she roundly and distressfully returned. “The master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed not to be well and the country so good for
               <pb n="65"/>him. So he had everything to say. Yes”—she let me have it—“even about <hi rend="italic">them</hi>.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Them—that creature?” I had to smother a kind of howl. “And you could bear it?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“No<anchor xml:id="VI.15"/>.<app from="VI.15"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">,</rdg></app> I couldn’t—and I can’t now!” And the poor woman burst into tears.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">A rigid control, from the next day, was, as I have said, to follow them; yet how often and how passionately, for a week, we came back together to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that Sunday night, I was, in the immediate later hours in especial—for it may be imagined whether I slept<anchor xml:id="VI.16"/>—<app from="VI.16"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">, </rdg></app>still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me. I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word Mrs. Grose had kept back. I was sure, moreover, by morning, that this was not from a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were fears. It seems to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrow’s sun was high I had restlessly read into the facts before us almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and more cruel occurrences. What they gave me above all was just the sinister figure of the living man—the dead one would keep <anchor xml:id="VI.17"/>awhile<app from="VI.17"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">a while</rdg></app>!—and of the months he had continuously passed at Bly, which, added up, made a formidable stretch. The
               <pb n="66"/>limit of this evil time had arrived only when, on the dawn of a winter’s morning, Peter Quint was found, by a <anchor xml:id="VI.18"/>labourer<app from="VI.18"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">laborer</rdg></app> going to early work, stone dead on the road from the village: a catastrophe explained—superficially at least—by a visible wound to his head; such a wound as might have been produced—and as, on the final evidence <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been—by a fatal slip, in the dark and after leaving the <anchor xml:id="VI.19"/>public house<app from="VI.19"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">public-house</rdg></app>, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much—practically, in the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been matters in his life—strange passages and perils, <anchor xml:id="VI.20"/>secret<app from="VI.20"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no20">secrets,</rdg></app> disorders, vices more than suspected—that would have accounted for a good deal more.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible picture of my state of mind; but I was, in these days, literally able to find a joy in the <anchor xml:id="VI.21"/>extraordinary flight of heroism<app from="VI.21"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">particular miracle of courage</rdg></app> the occasion demanded of me. I now saw that I had been asked for a service admirable and difficult; and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen—oh, in the right quarter!—that I could succeed where many another girl might have failed. It was an immense help to
               <pb n="67"/>me—I confess I rather applaud myself as I look back!—that I saw my service so strongly and so simply. I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s own committed heart. We were cut off, really, together; we were united in our danger. They had nothing but me, and I—well I had <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. It was in short a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me in an image richly material. I was a screen—I was to stand before them. The more I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi>, the less they would. I began to watch them in a stifled suspense, a disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too long, have turned to something like madness. What saved me<anchor xml:id="VI.22"/><app from="VI.22"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21"> that</rdg></app>, I now see, was that it turned to something else altogether. It didn’t last as suspense—it was superseded by horrible <anchor xml:id="VI.23"/>Proofs. Proofs,<app from="VI.23"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">facts. Facts</rdg></app> I say, yes—from the moment I really <anchor xml:id="VI.24"/>took hold<app from="VI.24"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">read them</rdg></app>.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">This moment dated from an afternoon hour that I happened to spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left Miles indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window-seat; he had wished to finish a book, and
               <pb n="68"/>I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the restless. His sister, on the contrary, had been alert to come out, and I strolled with her half an hour, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the day exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of how, like her brother, she contrived—it was the charming thing in both children—to let me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround. They were never importunate and yet never listless. My attention to them ail really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer. I walked in a world of their invention—they had no occasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and that Flora was playing very hard. We were
               <pb n="69"/>on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the lake was the Sea of Azof.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world—the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly merged itself. I had sat down, with a piece of work—for I was something or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlooked the pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet without direct vision, the presence, at a distance, of a third person. The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, but it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour. There was no ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction I from one moment to another found myself forming as to what I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of raising my eyes. They were attached at this juncture to the stitching in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my effort not to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able to make up my mind what
               <pb n="70"/>to do. There was <anchor xml:id="VI.25"/>an alien object<app from="VI.25"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">a third person</rdg></app> in view—a <anchor xml:id="VI.26"/>figure<app from="VI.26"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">person</rdg></app> whose right <anchor xml:id="VI.27"/>of presence<app from="VI.26"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">to be there</rdg></app> I instantly, passionately questioned. I recollect counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was more natural, for instance, than the appearance of one of the men about the place<anchor xml:id="VI.28"/>,<app from="VI.28"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21"/></app> or even of a messenger, a postman or a tradesman’s boy, from the village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as I was conscious—still even without looking—of its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were not.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, I transferred my eyes straight to little Flora, who, at the moment, was about ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I held my breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me. I waited, but nothing came; then, in the first place—and
               <pb n="71"/>there is something more dire in this, I feel, than in anything I have to relate—I was determined by a sense that, within a minute, all sounds from her had previously dropped; and, in the second, by the circumstance that, also within the minute, she had, in her play, turned her back to the lake. This was her attitude when I at last looked at her—looked with the confirmed conviction that we were still, together, under direct personal notice. She had picked up a small flat piece of wood, which happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a mast and make the thing a boat. This second morsel, while I watched her, she was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place. My apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some seconds I felt I was ready for more. Then I again shifted my eyes—I faced what I had to face.</p>

            <head rend="center">VII</head>
            <p rend="h_2">I got hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as I could; and I can give no intelligible account of how I fought out the interval. Yet I still hear myself cry as I fairly threw myself into her arms: “They <hi rend="italic">know</hi>—it’s too monstrous: they know, they know!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And what on earth<anchor xml:id="VII.1"/>—<app from="VII.1"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">—</rdg></app>?” I felt her incredulity as she held me.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Why, all that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> know—and heaven knows what besides!” Then, as she released me, I made it out to her, made it out perhaps only now with full coherency even to myself. “Two hours ago, in the garden”—I could scarce produce it—“Flora <hi rend="italic">saw!</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach. “She has told you?” she panted.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Not a word—that’s the horror. She kept it to herself! The child of <anchor xml:id="VII.2"/>eight<app from="VII.2"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">six</rdg></app>, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> child!” Unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction of it.</p>
            <pb n="73"/>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose, of course, could only gape the wider. “Then how do you know?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I was there—I saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Do you mean aware of <hi rend="italic">him?</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“No—of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.” I was conscious as I spoke that I looked prodigious things, for I got the slow reflection of them in my companion’s face. “Another person—this time; but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror and evil: a woman in black, pale and dreadful—with such an air also, and such a face!—on the other side of the lake. I was there with the child—quiet for the hour; and in the midst of it she came!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Came how—from where?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“From where they come from! She just appeared and stood there—but not so near.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And without coming nearer?”</p>
            <pb n="22"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as you!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">My friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. “Was she <anchor xml:id="VII.3"/>someone<app from="VII.3"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">some one</rdg></app> you’ve never seen?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yes. But <anchor xml:id="VII.4"/>someone<app from="VII.4"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">some one</rdg></app> the child has. <anchor xml:id="VII.5"/>Someone<app from="VII.5"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">Some one</rdg></app> <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have.” Then to show how I had thought it all out: “My predecessor—the one who died.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Miss Jessel?”</p>
            <pb n="74"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“Miss Jessel. You don’t believe me?” I pressed.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She turned right and left in her distress. “How can you be sure?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">This drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience. “Then ask Flora—<hi rend="italic">she’s</hi> sure!” But I had no sooner spoken than I caught myself up. “No, for God’s sake, <hi rend="italic">don’t<anchor xml:id="VII.6"/>!<app from="VII.6"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">:</rdg></app></hi> <anchor xml:id="VII.7"/>She'll<app from="VII.7"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">she’ll</rdg></app> say she isn’t—she’ll lie!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest. “Ah, how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Because I’m clear. Flora doesn’t want me to know.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“It’s only then to spare you.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“No, no—there are depths, depths! The more I go over it, the more I see it, and the more I see in it the more I fear. I don’t know what I <hi rend="italic">don’t</hi> see—what I <hi rend="italic">don’t</hi> fear!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose tried to keep up with me. “You mean you’re afraid of seeing her again?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh no; that’s nothing—now!” Then I explained. “It’s of <hi rend="italic">not</hi> seeing her.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">But my companion only looked wan. “I don’t understand you.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Why, it’s that the child may keep it up—and that the child assuredly <hi rend="italic">will</hi>—without my knowing it.”</p>
            <pb n="75"/>
            <p rend="h_2">At the image of this possibility Mrs. Grose for a moment collapsed, yet presently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would really be to give way to. “Dear, dear—we must keep our heads! And after all, if she doesn’t mind it<anchor xml:id="VII.8"/>―<app from="VII.8"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">—</rdg></app>!” She even tried a grim joke. “Perhaps she likes it!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Likes <hi rend="italic">such</hi> things—a <anchor xml:id="VII.9"/>a scrap of an infant<app from="VII.9"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">little girl of six</rdg></app>!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Isn’t it just a proof of her blessed innocence?” my friend bravely inquired.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She brought me, for the instant, almost round. “Oh, we must clutch at <hi rend="italic">that</hi>—we must cling to it! If it isn’t a proof of what you say, it’s a proof of—God knows what! For the woman’s a horror of horrors.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose, at this, fixed her eyes a minute on the ground; then at last raising them, “Tell me how you know,” she said.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Then you admit it’s what she <hi rend="italic">was!</hi>” I cried.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Tell me how you know,” my friend simply repeated.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Know? By seeing her! By the way she looked.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And you, do you mean—so wickedly?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Dear me, no—I could have borne that.
               <pb n="76"/>She gave me never a glance. She only fixed the child.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose tried to see it. “Fixed her?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Ah, with such awful eyes!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. “Do you mean of dislike?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“God help us, no! Of something much worse.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Worse than dislike?”—this left her indeed at a loss.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“With a determination—indescribable. With a kind of <anchor xml:id="VII.10"/>fury of intention<app from="VII.10"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no20">passion of purpose</rdg></app>.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I made her turn pale. “<anchor xml:id="VII.11"/>Intention<app from="VII.11"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">Purpose</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“To get hold of her.” Mrs. Grose—her eyes just lingering on mine—gave a shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking out I completed my statement. “<hi rend="italic">That’s</hi> what Flora knows.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">After a little she turned round, “The person was in black, you say?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“In mourning—rather poor, almost shabby. But—yes—with extraordinary beauty.” I now recognized to what I had at last, stroke by stroke, brought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weighed this. “Oh, handsome—very, very,” I insisted; “wonderfully handsome. But infamous.”</p>
            <pb n="77"/>
            <p rend="h_2">She slowly came back to me. “Miss Jessel—<hi rend="italic">was</hi> infamous.” She once more took my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if to fortify me against the increase of alarm I might draw from this admission. “They were both infamous,” she finally said.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">So, for a little, we faced it once more together; and I found, absolutely, a degree of help in seeing it now so straight. “I appreciate,” I said, “the great decency of your not having hitherto spoken; but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.” She appeared to assent to this, but still only in silence; seeing which I went on: “I must have it now. Of what did she die? Come, there was something between them.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“There was everything.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“In spite of the difference<anchor xml:id="VII.12"/>—<app from="VII.12"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">—</rdg></app>?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, of their rank, their condition”—she brought it <anchor xml:id="VII.13"/>woefully<app from="VII.13"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">wofully</rdg></app> out. “<hi rend="italic">She</hi> was a lady.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I turned it over; I again saw. “Yes—she was a lady.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And he so dreadfully below,” said Mrs. Grose.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I felt that I doubtless needn’t press too hard, in such company, on the place of a servant in the scale; but there was nothing to prevent
               <pb/>an acceptance of my companion’s own measure of my predecessor’s abasement. There was a way to deal with that, and I dealt; the more readily for my full vision<anchor xml:id="VII.14"/>—<app from="VII.14"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">, </rdg></app>on the evidence<anchor xml:id="VII.15"/>—<app from="VII.15"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">, </rdg></app>of our employer’s late clever, <anchor xml:id="VII.16"/>good-looking<app from="VII.16"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">good looking</rdg></app> “own” man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. “The fellow was a hound.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Mrs. Grose considered as if it were perhaps a little case for a sense of shades. “I’ve never seen one like him. He did what he wished.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“With her?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“With them all.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">It was as if <anchor xml:id="VII.17"/>now in my friend’s own eyes Miss Jessel had again appeared<app from="VII.17"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">Miss Jessel had again appeared in my friend’s remembering eyes</rdg></app>. I seemed at any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation of her as distinctly as I had seen her by the pond; and I brought out with decision: “It must have been also what <hi rend="italic">she</hi> wished!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Mrs. Grose’s face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at the same time: “Poor woman—she paid for it!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Then you do know what she died of?” I asked.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“No—I know nothing. I wanted <anchor xml:id="VII.18"/>not<app from="VII.18"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21"><hi rend="italic">not</hi></rdg></app> to know; I was glad enough I didn’t; and I thanked heaven she was well out of this!”</p>
            <pb n="79"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yet you had, then, your idea<anchor xml:id="VII.19"/>―<app from="VII.19"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Of her real reason for leaving? Oh yes—as to that. She <anchor xml:id="VII.20"/>couldn’t<app from="VII.20"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21"><hi rend="italic">couldn’t</hi></rdg></app> have stayed. Fancy it here—for a governess! And <anchor xml:id="VII.21"/>afterwards<app from="VII.21"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">afterward</rdg></app> I imagined—and I still imagine. And what I imagine is dreadful.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Not so dreadful as what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do,” I replied<anchor xml:id="VII.22"/>;<app from="VII.22"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no21">:</rdg></app> on which I must have shown her—as I was indeed but too conscious—a front of miserable defeat.

            <head rend="center">VIII</head>
            <p rend="h_2">What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. We were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else—difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. Late that night, while the house slept, we had <anchor xml:id="VIII.2"/>another talk in my room, when<app from="VIII.2"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">, in the schoolroom, another talk, and then</rdg></app> she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her perfectly in the pinch of <anchor xml:id="VIII.3"/>that<app from="VIII.3"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">this</rdg></app>, I found, I had only to ask her how, if I had “made it up,” I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks—a portrait on the exhibition of which she had in
               <pb n="81" break="no"/>stantly recognized and named them. She wished, of course<anchor xml:id="VIII.4"/>,<app from="VIII.4"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"/></app>—small blame to her!—to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it. I encountered her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence—for recurrence we took for granted—I should get used to my danger; distinctly professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my discomforts. It was my new suspicion that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the later hours of the day had brought a little ease.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively cultivate and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other words, plunged afresh into Flora’s special society and there became aware—it was almost a luxury!—that she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that ached. She had looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me, to my face of having “cried.” I had supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs<anchor xml:id="VIII.5"/>:<app from="VIII.5"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">;</rdg></app> but I could literally—for the time, at
               <pb n="82"/>all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not entirely disappeared. To gaze into the depths of blue of the child’s eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn’t abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat to Mrs. Grose—as I did there, over and over, in the small hours—that, with their voices in the air, their pressure on one’s heart and their fragrant faces against one’s cheek, everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that, somehow, to settle this once for all, I had, equally, to <anchor xml:id="VIII.6"/>re-enumerate<app from="VIII.6"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">renumerate</rdg></app> the signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake, had made a miracle of my show<anchor xml:id="VIII.7"/><app from="VIII.7"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">, at the moment,</rdg></app> of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to <anchor xml:id="VIII.8"/>re-investigate<app from="VIII.8"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">reinvestigate</rdg></app> the certitude of <anchor xml:id="VIII.9"/>the<app from="VIII.9"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">this</rdg></app> moment <anchor xml:id="VIII.10"/>itself <app from="VIII.10"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"/></app>and repeat how it had come to me as a revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was, for <anchor xml:id="VIII.11"/>either party,<app from="VIII.11"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">each of the parties to it, a matter quite</rdg></app> of habit. It was a pity that I should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she wanted, by
               <pb n="83"/>just so much as she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn’t, and at the same time, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did! It was a pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my attention—the perceptible increase of movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of nonsense and the invitation to romp.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review, I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still remained to me. I should not, for instance, have been able to asseverate to my friend that I was certain—which was so much to the good—that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> at least had not betrayed myself. I should not have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind<anchor xml:id="VIII.12"/>,<app from="VIII.12"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"/></app>—I scarce know what to call it<anchor xml:id="VIII.13"/>,<app from="VIII.13"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"/></app>—to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. She had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a great deal; but the blur of a <anchor xml:id="VIII.14"/>small shifty<app from="VIII.14"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">little dumb</rdg></app> spot <anchor xml:id="VIII.15"/>on then wrong side of<app from="VIII.15"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">behind</rdg></app> it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how on this occasion—for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help—I felt
               <pb n="84"/>the importance of giving the last <anchor xml:id="VIII.16"/>jerk<app from="VIII.16"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">pull</rdg></app> to the curtain. “I don’t believe anything so horrible,” I recollect saying; “no, let us put it definitely, my dear, that I don’t. But if I did, you know, there’s a thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit more—oh, not a scrap, come!—to get out of you. What was it you had in mind,<anchor xml:id="VIII.17"/><app from="VIII.17"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"> before Miles came back,</rdg></app> when, in our distress,<anchor xml:id="VIII.18"/><app from="VIII.18"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"> before Miles came back,</rdg></app> over the letter from his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didn’t pretend for him that he had not literally <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> been ‘bad’? He has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> literally ‘ever<anchor xml:id="VIII.19"/>,’<app from="VIII.19"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">’,</rdg></app> in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely <anchor xml:id="VIII.20"/>watched<app from="VIII.20"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">observed</rdg></app> him<anchor xml:id="VIII.21"/>;<app from="VIII.22"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">:</rdg></app> he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, <anchor xml:id="VIII.22"/>loveable<app from="VIII.22"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">lovable</rdg></app> goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to take. What was your exception, and to what passage in your personal observation of him did you refer?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but <anchor xml:id="VIII.23"/>levity<app from="VIII.23"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">gayety</rdg></app> was not our note, and, at any rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate I had got my answer. What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the purpose. It was <anchor xml:id="VIII.24"/>neither more nor<app from="VIII.24"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">nothing</rdg></app> less than the circumstance that for a period of several months Quint and the boy
               <pb n="85"/>had been perpetually together. It was <anchor xml:id="VIII.25"/>in fact the very appropriate truth<app from="VIII.25"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">nothing less than the circumstance</rdg></app> that she had ventured to criticise the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so close an alliance, and even to go so far <anchor xml:id="VIII.26"/><app from="VIII.26"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">as a frank overture </rdg></app>on the subject as a frank overture to Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a very strange manner, requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this, directly approached little Miles. What she had said to him, since I pressed, was that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> liked to see young gentlemen not forget their station.</p>
            <!-- pbs and illustration here in Colliers -->
            <p rend="h_2">I pressed again, of course, at this. “You reminded him that Quint was only a base menial?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“As you might say. And it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“And for another thing?” I waited. “He repeated your words to Quint?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“No, not that. It’s just what he <anchor xml:id="VIII.27"/><emph rend="italic">wouldn’t!</emph><app from="VIII.27"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"><hi rend="italic">would</hi>n’t!</rdg></app>” she could still impress upon me. “I was sure, at any rate,” she added, “that he didn’t. But he denied certain occasions.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“What occasions?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“When they had been about quite as if Quint <anchor xml:id="VIII.28"/>were<app from="VIII.28"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">had been</rdg></app> his tutor—and a very grand one—and Miss Jessel only for the little lady. When he had gone off with the fellow, I mean, and spent hours with him.”</p>
            <pb n="86"/>
            <p rend="h_2">“He then prevaricated about it—he said he hadn’t?” Her assent was clear enough to cause me to add in a moment: “I see. He lied.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh!” Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it didn’t matter; which indeed she backed up by a further remark. “You see, after all, Miss Jessel didn’t mind. She didn’t forbid him.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I considered. “Did he put that to you as a justification?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">At this she dropped again. “No, he never spoke of it.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Never mentioned her in connection with Quint?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">She saw, visibly <anchor xml:id="VIII.29"/>flushing<app from="VIII.29"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no23">coloring</rdg></app>, where I was coming out. “Well, he didn’t show anything. He denied,” she repeated; “he denied.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">Lord, how I pressed her now! “So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I don’t know—I don’t know!” the poor woman groaned.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“You do know, you dear thing,” I replied; “only you haven’t my dreadful boldness of mind, and you keep back, out of timidity and modesty and delicacy, even the impression that, in the past, when you had, without my aid, to flounder about
               <pb n="87"/>in silence, most of all made you miserable. But I shall get it out of you yet! There was something in the boy that suggested to you,” I continued, “that he covered and concealed their relation.”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh, he couldn’t prevent<anchor xml:id="VIII.30"/>―<app from="VIII.30"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Your learning the truth? I dare say! But, heavens,” I fell, with vehemence, a-thinking, “what it shows that they must, to that extent, have succeeded in making of him!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Ah, nothing that’s not nice <hi rend="italic">now!</hi>” Mrs. Grose lugubriously pleaded.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I don’t wonder you looked queer,” I persisted, “when I mentioned to you the letter from his school!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“I doubt if I looked as queer as <anchor xml:id="VIII.31"/>you!<app from="VIII.31"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"><hi rend="italic">you!</hi></rdg></app>” she retorted with homely force. “And if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an angel now?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Yes indeed—and if he was a fiend at school! How, how, <anchor xml:id="VIII.32"/>how?<app xml:id="VIII.32"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"><hi rend="italic">how?</hi></rdg></app> Well,” I said<anchor xml:id="VIII.33"/><app from="VIII.33"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">,</rdg></app> in my torment, “you must put it to me again, but I shall not be able to tell you for some days. Only, put it to me again!” I cried in a way that made my friend stare. “There are directions in which I must not for the present let myself go.” Meanwhile I returned to her first example—the one to
               <pb n="88"/>which she had just previously referred—of the boy’s happy capacity for an occasional slip. “If Quint—on your remonstrance, at the time you speak of—was a base menial, one of the things Miles said to you, I find myself guessing, was that you were another.” Again her admission was so adequate that I continued: “And you forgave him that?”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Wouldn’t <hi rend="italic">you?</hi>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Oh yes!” And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound of the oddest amusement. Then I went on: “At all events, while he was with the man<anchor xml:id="VIII.34"/>―<app from="VIII.34"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">—</rdg></app>”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">“Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them all!”</p>
            <p rend="h_2">It suited me too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it suited exactly the <anchor xml:id="VIII.34"/>particularly<app from="VIII.34"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">particular</rdg></app> deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the expression of this view that I will throw, just here, no further light on it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to Mrs. Grose. “His having lied and been impudent are, I confess, less engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of the little natural man. Still,” I mused, “they must do,
               <pb n="89"/>for they make me feel more than ever that I must watch.”<!-- para start and end in colliers --> It made me blush, the next minute, to see in my friend’s face how much more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing.

            <p rend="h_2">“Of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember that, until further evidence, I now accuse nobody.” Then, before shutting her out to go, by another passage, to my own place, “I must just wait,” I wound up.</p>

            <head rend="center">IX</head>
            <p rend="h_2">I waited and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from my consternation. A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstance that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark. I trembled lest they
               <pb n="91"/>should see that they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> so immensely more interesting. Putting things at the worst, at all events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could only be—blameless and foredoomed as they were—a reason the more for taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, I found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. As soon as I had done so I used to say to myself: “What will they think of that? Doesn’t it betray too much?” It would have been easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could <anchor xml:id="IX.1"/>still enjoy was<app from="IX.1"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">here and there catch is</rdg></app> that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, so<anchor xml:id="IX.2"/><app from="IX.1"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">,</rdg></app> too, I remember wondering if I mightn’t see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually <anchor xml:id="IX.3"/>bowed<app from="IX.3"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">languished</rdg></app> over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish suc
               <pb n="92" break="no"/>ceeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to <anchor xml:id="IX.4"/>catch<app from="IX.4"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">detect</rdg></app> them at a purpose in it. They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress; I mean—though they got their lessons better and better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as animals and historical characters<anchor xml:id="IX.5"/>, and above all astonishing her<app from="IX.5"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">. They astonished her above all</rdg></app> by the “pieces” they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite. I should never get to the bottom—were I to let myself go even now—of the prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction, with which, in these days; I overscored their full hours. They had shown me<anchor xml:id="IX.6"/><app from="IX.6"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">,</rdg></app> from the first<anchor xml:id="IX.7"/><app from="IX.7"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">,</rdg></app> a facility for everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans, but<anchor xml:id="IX.8"/><app from="IX.8"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"> masqueraded with brilliancy</rdg></app> as <anchor xml:id="IX.9"/>Shakespeareans<app from="IX.9"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">Shakespearans</rdg></app>, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which,
               <pb n="93"/>at this late day, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for Miles. What I remember is that I was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his <anchor xml:id="IX.10"/>perpetually striking<app from="IX.10"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">present supreme little</rdg></app> show of cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson’s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest<anchor xml:id="IX.11"/><app from="IX.11"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">,</rdg></app> if not the brightest<anchor xml:id="IX.12"/><app from="IX.12"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">,</rdg></app> thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that he was under some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous incitement.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone school, it was at least as <anchor xml:id="IX.13"/>marked<app from="IX.13"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">striking</rdg></app> that for such a boy to have been “kicked out” by a <anchor xml:id="IX.14"/>school-master<app from="IX.14"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">schoolmaster</rdg></app> was a mystification without end. Let me add that, in their company now—and I was careful almost never to be out of it—I could follow no scent very far. We lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals. The musical sense, in each of the children, was of the quickest, but the elder in especial had a <anchor xml:id="IX.15"/>marvellous<app from="IX.15"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">marvelous</rdg></app> knack of catching and repeating. The schoolroom piano broke into all <anchor xml:id="IX.16"/>gruesome<app from="IX.16"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">grewsome</rdg></app> fancies; and when that failed there were
               <pb n="94"/>confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out<anchor xml:id="IX.17"/><app from="IX.17"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">,</rdg></app> in the highest spirits<anchor xml:id="IX.18"/><app from="IX.18"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">,</rdg></app> in order to “come in” as something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age, sex and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either <anchor xml:id="IX.19"/>quarrelled<app from="IX.19"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">quarreled</rdg></app> or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness. Sometimes indeed, when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away. There is a <hi rend="italic">naïf</hi> side, I suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupils <anchor xml:id="IX.20"/>practised<app from="IX.20"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">practiced</rdg></app> upon me it was surely with the minimum of grossness. It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull, the grossness broke out.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge. In going on with the record of what was hideous at Bly I not only challenge the most liberal faith—for which I little care; but—and this is another matter—I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way through it to the end. There came suddenly an hour
               <pb n="95"/>after which, as I look back, the affair seems to
               <!--pb here in colliers-->
               me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is doubtless to advance. One evening—with nothing to lead up or to prepare it—I felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the night of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly—last-century fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand was Fielding’s <anchor xml:id="IX.21"/><hi rend="italic">Amelia</hi>; also<app from="IX.21"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">“Amelia” and</rdg></app> that I was <anchor xml:id="IX.22"/>wholly<app from="IX.22"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">very wide</rdg></app> awake. I recall <anchor xml:id="IX.23"/>further<app from="IX.23"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">also</rdg></app> both a general conviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to looking at my watch. I figure, <anchor xml:id="IX.24"/>finally<app from="IX.24"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">further</rdg></app>, that the white curtain draping, in the fashion of those days, the head of Flora’s little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest. <anchor xml:id="IX.25"/><app from="IX.25"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">Lastly </rdg></app>I recollect that, though I was deeply interested in my author, I found
               <pb n="96"/>myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered, looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room. There was a moment during which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been <anchor xml:id="IX.26"/>anyone<app from="IX.26"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">any one</rdg></app> to admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet and, taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of earliest morning rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant, I saw that there was <anchor xml:id="IX.27"/>someone<app from="IX.27"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">some one</rdg></app>
               <pb n="97"/>on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing <anchor xml:id="IX.28"/>half-way<app from="IX.28"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">half way</rdg></app> up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window, where, at sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden. He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common <anchor xml:id="IX.29"/>intensity<app from="IX.29"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">knowledge</rdg></app>. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable, dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn’t meet and measure him.</p>
            <p rend="h_2">I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had, thank God, no terror. And he knew I had not—I found myself at the end of an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce <anchor xml:id="IX.30"/>rigour<app from="IX.30"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">rigor</rdg></app> of confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease—for the time, at least—to have him to reckon with; and during the minute, accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous
               <pb n="98"/>just because it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> human, as human as to have met alone, in the small hours, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer, some criminal. It was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close quarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at such an hour<anchor xml:id="IX.31"/>,<app from="IX.31"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22"/></app> we still at least would have spoken. Something would have passed, in life, between us; if nothing had passed one of us would have moved. The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make me doubt if even <hi rend="italic">I</hi> were in life. I can’t express what followed it save by saying that the silence itself—which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my strength—became the element into which I saw the figure disappear; in which I definitely saw it turn, as I might have seen the <anchor xml:id="IX.32"/>low wretch<app from="IX.32"><rdg wit="Colliers-vol20no22">base varlet</rdg></app> to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was lost.</p>
